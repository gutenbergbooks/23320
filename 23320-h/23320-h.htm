<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> aim of the present study is to ascertain
as far as possible the standing of the
deaf, or, as they are so often called, the
"deaf and dumb," in society in America, and to
examine the treatment that has been accorded to
them&mdash;to present an account of an element of
the population of whom little is generally known.
In this effort regard is had not only to the interests
of the deaf themselves, but also, with the
growing concern in social problems, to the fixing
of a status for them in the domain of the social
sciences. In other words, the design may be said
to be to set forth respecting the deaf something
of what the social economist terms a "survey,"
or, as it may more popularly be described, to tell
"the story of 'the deaf and dumb.'"</p>

<p>The material employed in the preparation of
the work has been collected from various documents,
and from not a little personal correspondence:
from the reports and other publications
of schools for the deaf, of organizations interested
in the deaf, of state charities, education or other
departments, of the United States bureaus of
education and of the census; from the proceedings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of bodies interested in the education of the
deaf, of organizations composed of the deaf, of
state and national conferences of charities and
corrections; from the statutes of the several
states; and from similar publications. From the
<i>American Annals of the Deaf</i> the writer has
drawn unsparingly, and to it a very considerable
debt is owed. Valuable assistance has also been
obtained from the <i>Volta Review</i>, formerly the
<i>Association Review</i>, and from papers published
by the deaf or in schools for the deaf. Other
sources of information used will be noted from
time to time in the work itself.</p>

<p>For all that has been set down the writer is
alone responsible. He is, however, keenly mindful
of all the co-operation that has been given him,
and it would be most pleasant if it were possible to
relate by name those who have been of aid. Mere
words of thanks could but very little express
the sense of obligation that is felt towards all
of these. Indeed, one of the most delightful
features connected with the work has been the
response which as a rule has been elicited by the
writer's inquiries; and in some cases so courteous
and gracious have been the correspondents and
informants that one might at times think that a
favor were being done them in the making of the
request. To certain ones the writer cannot escape
mentioning his appreciation: to Dr. E. A. Fay,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
editor of the <i>American Annals of the Deaf</i>, and
vice-president of Gallaudet College; Dr. J. R.
Dobyns, of the Mississippi School, and secretary
of the Convention of American Instructors of the
Deaf; Mr. Fred Deland, of the Volta Bureau;
Mr. E. A. Hodgson, editor of the <i>Deaf-Mutes'
Journal</i>; Mr. E. H. Currier, of the New York
Institution, and Dr. T. F. Fox and Mr. Ignatius
Bjorlee, also of this institution; Dr. Joseph A.
Hill, of the Census Bureau; Mr. Alexander
Johnson, formerly secretary of the National Conference
of Charities and Corrections; Dr. H. H.
Hart, of the Russell Sage Foundation; Professor
S. M. Lindsay and Dr. E. S. Whitin, of Columbia
University; and to the officials of the
Library of Congress, of the New York Public
Library, of the New York State Library, of the
New York School of Philanthropy Library, of
the New York Academy of Medicine, of the
Columbia University Library, of the Volta Bureau,
and of the Gallaudet College Library.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Society</span> as a whole knows little of the
deaf, or the so-called deaf and dumb. They
do not form a large part of the population,
and many people seldom come in contact with
them. Their affliction to a great extent removes
them from the usual avenues of intercourse with
men and debars them from many of the social
activities of life, all tending to make the deaf
more or less a class apart in the community.
They would seem, then, to have received separate
treatment, as a section not wholly absorbed and
lost in the general population, but in a measure
standing out and differentiated from the rest of
their kind. Thus it comes that society has to take
notice of them. By reason of their condition
certain duties are called forth respecting them,
and certain provision has to be made for them.</p>

<p>The object of the present study of the deaf is
to consider primarily the attitude of society or
the state in America towards them, the duties it
has recognized in respect to them, the status it
has created for them, and the extent and forms,
as well as the adequacy and correctness, of this
treatment. Hence in our study of the problems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
of the deaf, the approach is not to be by the way
of medicine, or of law, or of education, though all
these aspects will be necessarily touched upon.
Nor is our study to deal with this class as a
problem of psychology or of mental or physical
abnormality, though more or less consideration
will have to be given to these points. Nor yet
again are we to concern ourselves principally with
what is known as the "human interest" question,
though we should be much disappointed if there
were not found an abundance of human interest
in what we shall have to consider. Rather, then,
we are to regard the deaf as certain components
of the state who demand classification and attention
in its machinery of organization. Our
attitude is thus that of the social economist, and
the object of our treatment is a part or section of
the community in its relation to the greater and
more solidified body of society.</p>

<p>More particularly, our purpose is twofold.
We first consider the deaf, who they are, and
their place in society, and then examine the one
great form of treatment which the state gives,
namely, the making of provision for their education.
This we have attempted to do in two
parts, Part I treating of the position of the deaf
in society, and Part II of the provisions made
for their education. As we shall find, the special
care of the state for the deaf to-day has assumed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
practically this one form. Means of education
are extended to all the state's deaf children, and
with this its attention for the most part ceases.
It has come to be seen that after they have received
an education, they deserve or require little
further aid or concern. But it has not always
been the policy of the state to allow to the deaf
the realization that they form in its citizenship
an element able to look out for themselves, and
demanding little of its special oversight. They
have a story full of interest to tell, for the way
of the deaf to the attainment of this position has
been long and tortuous, being first looked upon
as wards, and then by slow gradations coming to
the full rights and responsibilities of citizenship.
In this final stage, where the state provides
education for the deaf only as it provides it for
all others, and attempts little beyond, the deaf
find themselves on a level with citizens in general
in the state's regard.</p>

<p>In Part I, after we have ascertained who are
meant by the "deaf," and how many of them
there are, we are to find ourselves confronted by
a question which is of the foremost concern to
society; namely, whether the deaf are to be considered
a permanent part of the population, or
whether society may have means at hand to
eliminate or prevent deafness. After this, our
discussion will revolve about the deaf from different<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
points of view, regarding them in the
several aspects in which they appear to society.
We shall examine the treatment which the state
in general accords the deaf, how they are looked
upon in the law, and what changes have been
brought about in its attitude towards them. This
may be said to be the view of the publicist or
legalist. Next, we shall attempt to see how far
the deaf are really a class apart in the life of the
community. This will involve an examination,
on the one hand, as to whether their infirmity is
a bar to their independent self-support, that is,
whether they are potentially economic factors in
the world of industry, how far their status is due
to what they themselves have done, and to what
extent this result has modified the regard and
treatment of society; and, on the other, how far
their want of hearing stands in the way of their
mingling in the social life of the community in
which they live, whether the effect of this will tend
to force the deaf to associate more with themselves
than with the rest of the people, and what
forms their associations take. These will be the
views respectively of the economist and the sociologist.
Then we shall consider the regard in which
the deaf are popularly held, the view of "the man
in the street," and whether this regard is the
proper and just one. Lastly, we shall note what
movements have been undertaken in the interests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
of the deaf by private organizations, and to what
extent these have been carried.</p>

<p>In Part II we shall consider the provision that
has been made for the instruction of deaf children.
First we shall review the attempts at
instruction in the Old World, and then carefully
follow the development of instruction in America,
considering the early efforts in this direction, the
founding of the first schools, and the spread of
the work over the land; and noting how it was
first taken up by private initiative, in time to be
seconded or taken over by the state, and how far
the state has seen and performed its duty in this
respect. Public institutions have been created in
nearly all the states, and we shall examine the
organizations of these institutions and the general
arrangements in the different states. The
development of the work also includes a system of
day schools, a certain number of private schools
and a national college, all of which we shall consider,
devoting especial attention to the day
schools and their significance. Following this,
we shall consider how each state individually has
been found to provide for the instruction of the
deaf, observing also the extent to which the states
have made provision in their constitutions, and
the extent to which the schools are regarded as
purely educational. Next, we shall proceed to
inquire into the terms of admission of pupils into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
the schools; and we shall particularly concern
ourselves with the investigation of the question of
how far the means provided for education by the
state are actually availed of by the deaf. The
great technical problems involved in the education
of the deaf will be outside the province of
this work, but we shall indicate, so far as public
action may be concerned, the present methods of
instruction. This done, we shall mark what is
the cost to the state of all this activity for the
education of its deaf children, noting also how
far the state has been assisted in the work by
private benevolence. In the final chapter of our
study we shall set down the conclusions which we
have found in respect to the work for the deaf on
the whole in the United States.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE DEAF IN THE UNITED STATES</h3>


<h4>Meaning of Term "Deaf" in the Present Study</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">By</span> the "deaf" in the present study is meant
that element of the population in which
the sense of hearing is either wholly absent
or is so slight as to be of no practical value; or in
which there is inability to hear and understand
spoken language; or in which there exists no real
sound perception. In other words, those persons
are meant who may be regarded as either totally
deaf or practically totally deaf.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> With such
deafness there is not infrequently associated an
inability to speak, or to use vocal language.
Hence our attention may be said to be directed
to that part of the community which, by the want
of the sense of hearing and oftentimes also of
the power of speech, forms a special and distinct
class; and is known, more or less inaccurately,
as the "deaf and dumb" or "deaf-mutes" or
"mutes."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>In our discussion it is with deafness that we are
primarily concerned. <i>Deafness</i> and <i>dumbness</i>
are, physically, two essentially different things.
There is no anatomical connection between the
organs of hearing and those of speech; and the
structure and functioning of each are such as
to preclude any direct pathological relation. The
number of the so-called deaf and dumb, moreover,
who are really dumb is very small&mdash;so small
actually as to be negligible. Almost all who
are spoken of as deaf and dumb have organs of
speech that are quite intact, and are, indeed, constructively
perfect. It comes about, however,
that dumbness&mdash;considered as the want of normal
and usual locution&mdash;though organically separate
from deafness, is a natural consequence of it;
and does, as a matter of fact, in most cases to
a greater or less extent, accompany or co-exist
with it. The reason of this is that the deaf,
particularly those who have always been so, being
unable to hear, do not know how to use their
organs of speech, and especially are unable to
modulate their speech by the ear, as the hearing
do. If the deaf could regain their hearing, they
would have back their speech in short order. The
character of the human voice depends thus on the
ear to an unrealized degree.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>


<h4>Number of the Deaf in the United States</h4>

<p>According to the census of 1900 there were
37,426 persons in the United States enumerated
as totally deaf;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and according to that of 1910
there were 43,812 enumerated as "deaf and
dumb."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Hence we may assume that there are
between forty and fifty thousand deaf persons in
the United States forming a special class.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The following table will give the number of
the deaf in the several states and the number per
million of population, according to the census of
1910.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</table></div>


<p>From this table the largest proportions of the
deaf appear to be found in the states rather toward
the central part of the country, and the
smallest in the states in the far west and the extreme
east. The highest proportions occur in
Kentucky, North Carolina, Utah, Indiana,
West Virginia, Maryland, Tennessee, Missouri,
Kansas, Virginia, New Mexico, Ohio, South
Dakota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, New York, and
Minnesota, all these states having over 500 per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
million of population. The lowest proportions
are found in Wyoming, Arizona, New Jersey,
Nevada, Florida, Delaware, Connecticut, Colorado,
Montana, Washington, Massachusetts,
California, District of Columbia, Idaho, Vermont,
Oregon, Alabama, and Rhode Island, in
none of these states the number being over 400
per million. Why there should be these differences
in the respective proportions of the deaf
in the population of the several states, we cannot
say; and we are generally unable to determine to
what the variations are to be ascribed&mdash;whether
they are to be set down to particular conditions
of morbidity, the intensity of congenital deafness,
or other influences operating in different sections;
or, perhaps in some measure, to the greater
thoroughness with which the census was taken in
some places than in others.</p>


<h4>Age When Deafness Occurred</h4>

<p>The vast majority of the deaf lost their hearing
in early life, and most of them in the tender years
of infancy and childhood. More than ninety per
cent (90.6, according to the returns of the
census) became deaf before the twentieth year;
nearly three-fourths (73.7 per cent) under
five; over half (52.4 per cent) under two; and
over a third (35.5 per cent) were born deaf.
Deafness thus occurs in a strongly diminishing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
ratio with advancing years.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> These facts may
be indicated by the following table,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> which
shows the percentages of those who became deaf
at different ages.</p>

<h4>Ability of the Deaf to Speak</h4>

<p>We have just seen that "dumbness" frequently
follows upon deafness, or that it is
usually believed to be an effect of deafness. It
is true that with the majority of the deaf phonetic
speech is not employed to any large extent; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
there is at the same time a fair number who can,
and do, use vocal language. This speech varies
to a wide degree, in some approximating normal
speech, and in others being harsh and understood
with difficulty; and it depends in the main upon
three conditions: 1. the age at which deafness
occurred, this being the most important factor;
2. the extent to which the voice is cultivated; and
3. the remaining power of the ear (which is found
but seldom).<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Of the deaf persons enumerated in the census,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
21.5 per cent were reported able to speak well;
15.8 per cent imperfectly; and 62.7 per cent not
at all. In other words, somewhat over a third of
the deaf can speak more or less, one-fifth being
able to speak well, and one-sixth imperfectly,
while over three-fifths do not speak at all. The
dependence of the ability to speak upon the age
of becoming deaf is clearly in evidence here, the
proportion of those not able to speak showing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
great decrease with the rise of this age. Thus, of
those born deaf, 83.5 per cent cannot speak at
all; of those becoming deaf after birth and under
five, 74.6 per cent; of those becoming deaf after
five and under twenty, 26.5 per cent; and of those
becoming deaf after twenty, 3.4 per cent.</p>

<p>Some of the deaf are able to read the lips of
the speaker, or as it is better expressed, to read
speech, or to understand what is being said by
watching the motions of the mouth. This in
reality is a distinct art from the ability to speak,
though popularly they are often thought to be
co-ordinate or complementary one to the other.
Like the ability to speak, it varies in wide degree,
from the ability to understand simple and easy
expressions only, to the ability to follow protracted
discourse; and like the ability to speak,
it is found in increasing frequency with the rise
of the age of becoming deaf. According to the
census,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> 38.6 per cent of the deaf are able to read
the lips. Of those born deaf, 28.0 per cent have
this ability; of those becoming deaf after birth
and under five, 37.1 per cent; of those becoming
deaf after five and under twenty, 64.3 per cent;
and of those becoming deaf after twenty, 43.6 per
cent.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<h4>Means of Communication Employed by the Deaf</h4>

<p>If the larger number of the deaf do not use
the speech which is used by those who can hear,
how is it that their communication is carried on?
The chief method is a certain silent tongue peculiar
to the deaf, known as the "sign language,"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
a part of which may be said to be the
manual alphabet, or the system of finger-spelling,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
the two usually going hand in hand. In this way
most of the deaf are enabled to communicate with
each other readily and fluently. But this language,
or at least the greater part of it, not being
known to people generally, the deaf frequently
have to fall back on writing to convey their ideas
in communicating with hearing persons. This,
while slow and cumbersome, is the surest and most
reliable method of all. In addition, as we have
seen, a certain number of the deaf are able to use
speech, which of course has manifold advantages.
These are the several methods, then, of communication
employed by the deaf; but they are
not usually employed singly, as most of the deaf
are able to use two or more. According to the
census,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the sign language alone or in combination
with other methods is employed by 68.2 per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
cent, or over two-thirds of the deaf; finger-spelling
by 52.6 per cent, or over one-half; writing by
almost the same proportion&mdash;51.9 per cent; and
speech by 39.8 per cent, or some two-fifths. It is
probable, however, that the proportions employing
the sign language, finger-spelling and writing,
either singly or with other methods, are really
somewhat larger. In this case, likewise, we find
that the lower the age of becoming deaf, the
smaller is the proportion of the deaf with speech,
which shows again the connection of the ability
to speak with the age of the occurrence of deafness.
Of those born deaf, speech alone or in combination
with other methods is used by 18.2 per
cent; of those becoming deaf after birth and
under five, by 27.4 per cent; of those becoming
deaf after five and under twenty, by 75.3 per
cent; and of those becoming deaf after twenty,
by 97.7 per cent.</p>

their power to speak is to regard them roughly as falling into
three great divisions: 1. "Deaf-mutes," who come nearest to
being deaf and dumb. They have always been deaf, and have
never had natural speech. What speech they may possess has
come from special instruction, with the result that it is more
or less artificial. 2. "Semi-mutes," who are deaf, but who have
once had hearing as well as speech; and this speech they are
able to use to a greater or less degree, though in time it is
likely to become more and more astray. 3. "Semi-deaf" persons,
who are only partly deaf, and possess a little hearing,
though it is too slight to be of real practical use; and who
have voices most nearly approaching the normal. They belong
somewhere between the really deaf and the hard of hearing.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE DEAF AS A PERMANENT ELEMENT OF
THE POPULATION</h3>


<h4>Increase in the Number of the Deaf in Relation to
the Increase in the General Population</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Are</span> the deaf to be a permanent element in
the constitution of the population? Are
they always to be reckoned with in the life
of the state and the regard of society? Would
it not be well to inquire whether or not deafness
may be eliminated, or at least reduced to an appreciable
degree? These are questions that
present themselves at the outset in a consideration
of the relation of the deaf to society, and to
them we now devote our attention.</p>

<p>Our first inquiry in the matter is directed to
the question whether deafness as a whole is increasing,
decreasing or remaining stationary, in
relation to the general population. To determine
this, we have recourse to the census returns
of the deaf in connection with those of the general
population. Unfortunately, however, comparisons
of the different censuses respecting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
deaf are not altogether to be depended upon, for
the reason that they have not always been taken
on the same basis, and conclusions from them
consequently have to be accepted with qualifications.
Special census returns of the deaf have
been made since 1830; but the censuses of 1830-1870
purport to be of the deaf and dumb; the
census of 1880, of the deaf who became deaf
under sixteen years of age; that of 1890, of the
deaf and dumb; that of 1900, of the totally deaf;
and that of 1910, of the deaf and dumb. The
results thus obtained are in the main analogous,
but there are a certain number of cases included
on one basis that would be excluded on another,
and <i>vice versa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Taking the statistics as they are, we have the
following table,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> which gives the number of the
deaf as found in the several censuses, according
to the bases upon which they were made, together
with the ratio per million of population.</p>

<p class="hdtab">NUMBER OF THE DEAF ACCORDING TO THE CENSUSES
OF 1830-1910</p>

<tr><td class="tdlf">1910 (the deaf and dumb)</td><td class="tdr2">43,812</td><td class="tdr2">476</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>From this table there appears to be a steady decrease
in the number of the deaf in relation to the
general population from 1830 to 1860, this latter
year seeming to be the low water mark. From
1860 to 1870 there is a slight increase, and from
1870 to 1880 a very large one, due to some extent
to the method of taking the census. From 1880
to 1890 there is a certain decrease, though the
proportion is still very high. From 1890 to 1900
there is a very considerable decrease, probably
indicating a return to true conditions; and a not
negligible decrease from 1900 to 1910.</p>

<p>On the whole, with respect to these statistics,
probably the most that we can safely say is that
deafness is at least not on the increase relatively
among the population, while there is a possibility
that at present it is decreasing. For further determinations,
we shall have to seek other means of
inquiry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Adventitiously Deaf and the Congenitally
Deaf</h4>

<p>We may perhaps best approach the problem of
deafness as an increasing or decreasing phenomenon
in the population, if we think of the deaf as
composed of two great classes: those adventitiously
deaf, that is, those who have lost their
hearing by some disease or accident occurring
after birth, and those congenitally deaf, that
is, those who have never had hearing.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In regard
to the former class, it follows that we are largely
interested in the consideration of those diseases,
especially those of childhood, which may affect the
hearing, and in their prevention or diminution we
can endeavor to ascertain how far there are possibilities
of reducing the number of the deaf of
this class. In the latter case we are called upon
to examine some of the great problems involved
in the study of heredity, especially in respect to
the extent that the offspring is affected by defects
or abnormalities of the parent, and to see what, if
any, means are at hand to alter conditions that
bring about this form of deafness. We shall first
discuss the causes of adventitious deafness, together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
with the possibilities of its prevention and
the likelihood of its diminution, and then consider
the questions involved in congenital deafness.</p>


<h4>Adventitious Deafness and its Causes</h4>

<p>From three-fifths to two-thirds of the cases of
deafness are caused adventitiously&mdash;by accident
or disease. To accidents, however, only a very
small part are due, probably less than one-fiftieth
of the entire number.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Nearly all adventitious
deafness results from some disease, either as a
primary disease of the auditory organs, or as a
sequence or product of some disease of the system,
often one of infectious character, the deafness
thus constituting a secondary malady or ailment.
The larger portion is of the latter type, probably
less than a fourth resulting from original ear
troubles.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> In either case deafness occurs usually
in infancy or childhood, and does its harm by
attacking the middle or internal ear.</p>

<p>From diseases of the middle ear results over
one-fourth (27.2 per cent, according to the census)
of all deafness, and from diseases of the internal
ear, one-fifth (20.7 per cent), very little (0.6<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
per cent) being caused by disorders of the
outer ear. Of the classified cases of deafness, according
to the census, 56.3 per cent are due to
diseases affecting the middle ear, and 42.7 per
cent to diseases affecting the internal. Of diseases
of the middle ear, 72 per cent are of suppurative
character, often with inflammation or
abscess, and 28 per cent non-suppurative, or
rather catarrhal in character. Of diseases of the
internal ear, 89 per cent are affections of the
nerve, and 10 per cent of the labyrinth. It is to
be noted that when the affection is of the internal
ear, the result is usually total deafness.</p>

<p>By specified diseases, the leading causes of
deafness are scarlet fever (11.1 per cent), meningitis
(9.6), brain fever (4.7), catarrh (3.6),
"disease of middle ear" (3.6), measles (2.5),
typhoid fever (2.4), colds (1.6), malarial fever
(1.2), influenza (0.7), with smaller proportions
from diphtheria, pneumonia, whooping cough, la
grippe, and other diseases. A large part of deafness
is seen to be due to infectious diseases, the
probabilities being that fully one-third is to be
so ascribed, with one-fifth from infectious fevers
alone.</p>

<p>After birth and under two years of age, the
chief causes of deafness are meningitis, scarlet
fever, disease of middle ear, brain fever, and
measles. From two to five scarlet fever and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
meningitis are far in the lead, with many cases
also from brain fever, disease of middle ear,
measles, and typhoid fever. From five to ten
scarlet fever alone outdistances all other diseases,
followed in order by meningitis, brain fever and
typhoid fever. From ten to fifteen the main
causes are meningitis, scarlet fever, brain fever,
and catarrh; from fifteen to twenty catarrh and
meningitis; from twenty to forty catarrh, colds
and typhoid fever; and from forty on, catarrh.</p>

<p>The following table<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> will show in detail the
several causes of deafness and their respective

<h4>Possible Action for the Prevention of Adventitious
Deafness</h4>

<p>In respect to present activities for the prevention
of adventitious deafness, we find the situation
very much like that of marking time. Deafness,
since the beginning of time, has largely been
accepted as the portion of a certain fraction of
the race, and any serious and determined efforts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
for its eradication have been considered for the
most part as of little hope.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> With the auditory
organs so securely hidden away in the head,
entrenched within the protecting temporal bone,
and with their structure so delicate and complicated,
the problem may well have been regarded
a baffling one even for the best labor of
medicine and surgery. Hence it is that after
deafness has once effected lodgment in the system,
a cure has not usually been regarded as
within reach, though for certain individual cases
there may be medical examination and treatment,
with attempts made at relief. For deafness in
general, it has been felt that there has been little
that could be done in the way of prevention or
cure beyond the preservation of the general
health and the warding off of diseases that might
cause loss of hearing.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, altogether too
little attention has been given hitherto to the
possibilities of the prevention of deafness. Without
question there is much at the outset that can
be accomplished towards the prevention of those
diseases that cause deafness. A large part, perhaps
fully a third, as we have seen, are due to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
infectious diseases, and it is probably here that
measures are likely to be most efficacious. A
considerable portion likewise are the result of
diseases affecting the passages of the nose and
throat, and help should be possible for many of
these if taken in hand soon enough. In certain
diseases also, as scarlet fever, measles, typhoid
fever, diphtheria, and others, there are not a few
cases which, so far as deafness as a development
is concerned, would prove amenable to skillful
and persistent treatment. At the same time due
attention to primary ear troubles would in a number
of instances keep off permanent deafness.
Indeed, it is possible that some thirty or forty
per cent of adventitious deafness is preventable
by present known means.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Aside from direct medical treatment for those
diseases that cause deafness, there are other
measures available in a program for the prevention
of deafness. One of the foremost essentials
is the report to the health authorities of all serious
diseases that are liable to result in deafness.
In this way proper medical care may be secured,
and due precautions may be taken to
isolate infectious cases. Even with meningitis,
which is so hard usually to deal with and which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
so severe in its ravages, there is often some concomitant
trouble, and if made notifiable in all
cases deafness from it might be checked in no
inconsiderable measure. The report of births is
also especially needed, and as it becomes obligatory
in general, with the consequent detection of
physical ailments or disabilities, early cases of
deafness may come increasingly to notice, and
timely treatment may be availed of. Particular
attention is likewise necessary in respect to the
medical examination of school children. The
proportion of such children with impaired hearing
is not slight, even though no great part of
them become totally deaf. A committee on
defective eyes and ears of school children of
the National Educational Association in 1903
found that of 57,072 children examined in seven
cities, 2,067, or 3.6 per cent, were extremely
defective in hearing.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> An investigation of the
school children in New York City has disclosed
the fact that one per cent have seriously
defective hearing.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Under proper and adequate
medical inspection of schools, not only would the
need of treatment for adenoids and similar
troubles be brought to light, with the result that
a number of incipient cases might be stopped in
time, but in some instances of deafness already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
acquired beneficial treatment might be possible.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>There is thus a considerable sphere for action
towards the prevention of adventitious deafness
both by legislation and by education. For the
ultimate solution of its problems, however, we
have to look mainly to the medical profession.
In recent years medical science has won some
great triumphs, and in the field of the prevention
of deafness no little may be in store to be
accomplished in the years to come.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Even now,
with more particular attention to the diseases of
children, and with stronger insistence upon general
sanitary measures, the probabilities are that
there is less deafness from certain diseases than
formerly&mdash;a matter which we are soon to consider.</p>

<p>Though as yet there has been little direct
action for the prevention of adventitious deafness,
there is an increasing concern in the matter,
and in this there is promise. By medical bodies
in particular is greater attention being given to
the subject,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and in the widening recognition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of their part as guardians of the public health
it may be possible for them to do much for the
enlightenment of the public. In one state
legislative action has been taken expressly for
the protection of the hearing of school children.
This is Massachusetts, which requires the examination
of the eyes and ears of the school children
in every town and city, the state board of
education furnishing the tests.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In some states
also general inspection of schools is mandatory
by statute, and in others permissive, while in
several there are local ordinances with the force of
a state law.</p>

<p>In combating adventitious deafness, then, our
attack is to be directed in the largest part
upon those diseases, especially infantile and
infectious diseases, that cause deafness; and it is
upon the checking of their spread that our main
efforts for the present have to be concentrated.
At the same time the better safe-guarding of the
general health of the community will insure a
proportionate diminution of deafness. Beyond
this, we will have to wait upon the developments
of medical science, both in the study of the prevention
of diseases and of their treatment; and
can trust only to what it may offer.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h4>Adventitious Deafness as an Increasing or Decreasing
Phenomenon</h4>

<p>Our main interest in the problem of adventitious
deafness lies in the possible discovery
whether or not it is relatively increasing or decreasing
among the population, and in what
respects signs appear of a diminution. We have
just seen the likelihood of a decrease from certain
causes; but we are to find what is indicated by
statistical evidence.</p>

<p>To be considered first is adventitious deafness
as a whole. Respecting it our only statistics are
in the returns of the censuses since 1880, the different
forms of deafness not being distinguished
before this time. The following table will show
the number of the adventitiously deaf as reported
by the censuses of 1880, 1890 and 1900, with their
respective percentages and ratios per million of
population.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>From this it appears that adventitious deafness
is increasing in relation to total deafness, which
is most likely the case, as congenital deafness, as
we shall see, is evidently decreasing. Whether or
not adventitious deafness is increasing in respect
to the general population, the table does not disclose
definitely. The statistics probably are not
full enough to afford any real indication yet.</p>

<p>Our next inquiry is in respect to the increase
or decrease of adventitious deafness from the
several diseases individually, which is, upon the
whole, the more satisfactory test. Here also,
unfortunately, our statistics are very limited, and
our findings will have to fall much short of what
could be desired.</p>

<p>The following table, based on the returns of
the censuses of 1880, 1890 and 1900, so far as the
approximate identity of the several diseases can
be established, will give the respective percentages
found.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In this table the most noticeable thing is perhaps
the persistency with which we find most of the
diseases to recur, with apparently no great
change, while in certain ones, as catarrh and
malarial and typhoid fevers, there seems to be
rather an increase. It would be best, however,
not to place very great confidence in these figures,
but, so far as the census reports are concerned,
to wait for more precise and uniform statistics.</p>

<p>We have, further, the statistics published in
the reports of certain schools for the deaf. While
these are perhaps not of sufficient extent to warrant
full conclusions, they may be regarded as
quite representative;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and though to be taken
with something of the caution as the census
figures, they may serve to throw some light upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the situation. Comparison of the proportions of
pupils deaf from the several diseases at different
times may be made in two ways: by finding the
respective proportions over a series of successive
years from a certain time back down to the
present, and by contrasting the proportions in
two widely separated periods, one in the present
and one in the past. These will be taken up in
order.</p>

<p>The following tables give the percentages of
cases of deafness in pupils from the important
diseases as found in six schools in successive
years: in the New York Institution in the total
annual attendance from 1899 to 1912; in the
Michigan School in the total biennial attendance
from 1883 to 1912; in the Pennsylvania Institution
in the number of new pupils admitted
quadriennially from 1843 to 1912; in the Western
Pennsylvania Institution in the number admitted
biennially from 1887 to 1912; in the Maryland
School in the number admitted biennially from
1884 to 1911; and in the Wisconsin School in the
number admitted biennially from 1880 to 1908.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>We may take these tables together to see how
the proportions of deafness from the leading diseases
have changed in the course of the several
periods indicated, proper allowance being made
for the shorter length of time covered in some
schools than in others. In respect to scarlet fever,
one of the two foremost causes, we find in the
New York Institution, the Michigan School and
the Maryland School, a distinct and steady decline;
in the Pennsylvania Institution a decline of
late years, which is especially significant in view
of the extended period covered by it; and in the
Western Pennsylvania and the Wisconsin School
little change, though in the latter there is
less than at the beginning. In meningitis, on
the other hand, the second of the two most important
causes, a marked increase is seen in the
Pennsylvania Institution for the entire period,
while in the New York a sharp increase is
found in the time designated, this being all the
more noticeable because of the large proportion
already attributed here to convulsions, often a
trouble of kindred origin. In the Western Pennsylvania
Institution and the Maryland School
little change is observed, though in the latter some
decline is apparent in the later years. In the
Wisconsin and Michigan schools a very strong
decline is seen. On somewhat the same order as
meningitis is brain fever. It, however, shows little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
change on the whole, though in the Michigan and
Maryland schools and the New York Institution
some decline is evident. Of the remaining diseases
none plays singly a large part in the causation
of deafness, and in most of them the results
are similar. Measles, typhoid fever, diphtheria,
pneumonia, and whooping cough show, with some
fluctuations at times, little change on the whole,
beyond certain local differences. In the New
York Institution a decline is reported in nearly
all. In the Pennsylvania Institution a rather
larger proportion for measles is seen in later than
in earlier years. In the Michigan School an increase
seems to be the case with whooping cough,
but a decrease with typhoid fever. In catarrh
the results are not so uniform. In the New York
and Pennsylvania institutions a decline is manifest,
though in the latter a larger proportion is
reported than at the beginning. In the Michigan
and Wisconsin schools rather an increase is
noted. La grippe is only reported occasionally
of late years, and its real effects cannot yet be
ascertained. With respect to general fevers,
their classification is found to be so varying that
little can be determined.</p>

<p>We now proceed to make comparison of the
proportions of deafness from the principal diseases
in a series of years some time past with
similar proportions in recent years. The following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
tables give the several proportions in the
American School (Connecticut) in the entire
attendance from 1817 to 1844 and from 1817
to 1857, and in the new admissions from 1901 to
1913; in the Ohio School in the entire attendance
from 1829 to 1872, and in the average annual
attendance in 1904, 1905, 1906, and 1911; in the
Iowa School in the entire attendance from 1855
to 1870 and from 1855 to 1912; and in the New
York Institution in the entire attendance from
1818 to 1853 and in the average annual attendance
from 1899 to 1912.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Taking these tables also collectively, we find
in respect to scarlet fever a decline in all the
schools, this being especially pronounced in the
case of the Ohio. In meningitis, however, there
is an increase so heavy as to call in question the
accuracy of the earlier records; and it is possible
that it failed to be entirely recognized then. In
most of the other diseases, as in the previous case,
no very great change is perceptible. In general
fevers a decline is apparent in all, in most being
considerable; and probably several diseases were
formerly included which are now listed separately.
In measles rather a decline is found in
the American and Ohio schools, but a slight increase
in the Iowa, and a somewhat larger one in
the New York Institution. In typhoid fever
there is a slight increase also in the Iowa School,
but a decrease in the Ohio. In brain fever a
considerable increase is observed in the Iowa
School, but a slight decrease likewise in the Ohio.
In whooping cough there is an increase in the
New York Institution and the Iowa School, but
a decrease in the American. Such diseases as
pneumonia, diphtheria and catarrh seem not
usually to have been separately classified in the
past, though in the Ohio School we find diphtheria
noted, and with somewhat smaller proportions
than in later years; while in several of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
schools we find "colds" given in former times,
which may have been in part really catarrh.</p>

<p>Combining now the results of our two groups
of tables, we may be able to reach some conclusions
with respect to the increase or decrease of
deafness from certain diseases, though on the
whole far less definite than we could wish. In the
first place, it seems safe to affirm that deafness
from scarlet fever is becoming relatively less
with the years; and it is possible that if it continues
its present rate of decline, it will in time
cease to be one of the main causes of deafness.
On the other hand, meningitis, its great companion
in evil, shows a striking increase in comparison
with past years, as a cause of adventitious
deafness; while its accretion may be traced as
well in a series of recent years in certain schools,
though not in others. But how far there is an
absolute increase in meningitis over the past, and
whether it is tending at present actually to increase,
may be a matter for question. In view of
the possibility that the disease was not sufficiently
accounted for in the past, and in the absence of
any knowledge to indicate a reason for its less
prevalence in earlier years, at least not to the extent
indicated by the statistics, it may be that its
increase is, after all, more apparent than real.
The fact, moreover, that in the series of recent
years a marked increase is found in some schools,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
but a marked decline in others, may perhaps be
taken to mean that at present meningitis may be
on the increase only in certain sections, depending
possibly on local conditions. With the
greater medical skill of to-day, and with a larger
proportion of children in the schools, it may be
open to considerable doubt if the movement of
this disease is really one of increase, though it
seems that we are on the whole making no great
headway against it.</p>

<p>As to the minor diseases causing deafness, our
statistics do not indicate just to what extent and
in what direction deafness from them is being
affected, and no precise conclusions can at
present be set down. It is probable, however,
that with the increased attention to children's
diseases, as we have noted, there is really less
deafness from most of them than formerly.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<h4>The Congenitally Deaf</h4>

<p>When we come to consider the question of
congenital deafness, which comprises a little over
a third of the total amount of deafness, we have
an even more difficult problem on our hands, for
here we are to deal with some of the great questions
of heredity&mdash;though hereditary deafness
and congenital deafness are not altogether one
and the same thing.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> For the purposes of our
inquiry, let us think of the congenitally deaf as
divided into three great classes in respect to their
family relations: 1. the offspring of parents who
were cousins; 2. the offspring of parents who
were themselves deaf or members of families in
which there are other deaf relatives; and 3. the
product of families without either consanguinity
or antecedent deafness. Of these three classes
the first two only will engage our attention. Of
the last, comprising, according to the census,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
nine-twentieths, or 44.4 per cent, of the congenitally
deaf, there is not much that we can say.
For a great part of it there no doubt exists in the
parent, or perhaps in a more remote ancestor,
some abnormal strain, physical or mental, in the
nature of disease or other defect. But in respect
to such deafness we have too little in the way of
statistical data to help us arrive at any real determination;
and for it as a whole we shall have to
wait till we have greater knowledge of eugenics
and the laws of heredity.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>


<h4>The Offspring of Consanguineous Marriages</h4>

<p>Not all the deaf born of consanguineous
marriages are congenitally deaf, but as the
majority are so, and as the fact of the parents
being blood relatives is assumed to have at least a
contributing influence in the result, we may consider
the matter in this place. It is in fact closely
connected with the question of deaf relatives in
general.</p>

<p>In the census investigations,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> of the number
who answered on this point, 2,525, or 7.4 per
cent, have parents who were cousins. Of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
cases, deafness occurred in 87 per cent before the
fifth year of age, and in 60 per cent at birth.
Of all the deaf born without hearing, 13.5 per
cent are the offspring of consanguineous marriages.
The proportion of those born deaf is
thus nearly twice as great when the parents are
cousins as it is among the whole class of the
congenitally deaf; and the proportion is also
nearly twice as great of the offspring of consanguineous
marriages among the congenitally
deaf as the proportion of the deaf from such
marriages among the total number of the deaf.
Moreover, 55.0 per cent of the offspring of
cousin-marriages have deaf relatives of some
kind, and of the congenitally deaf from cousin-marriages,
65.6 per cent have deaf relatives;
while the respective proportions when the
parents are not cousins are 25.5 per cent and
40.7 per cent&mdash;in the one case less than half, and
in the other two-thirds, as great.</p>

<p>Further statistics bear out the findings of the
census. Dr. E. A. Fay in his "Marriages of the
Deaf"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>&mdash;a work we are soon to notice&mdash;finds
that, though consanguineous marriages form
only about one per cent of the total number considered,
30.0 per cent of the children of deaf
parents who are cousins are deaf, and that 45.1
per cent of such marriages result in deaf offspring;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
but that when the parents are not cousins,
the respective proportions are 8.3 per cent and
9.3 per cent&mdash;only about a fourth and a fifth
as great. In the Colorado School, out of 567
pupils in attendance from the beginning to 1912,
in 17, or 3 per cent, the parents were related
before marriage. In the Kentucky School, out
of 83 pupils admitted in 1910 and 1911, 18, or
19.3 per cent, and out of 42 admitted in 1912
and 1913, 8, or 19 per cent, were the offspring
of parents who were cousins. In the Iowa
School, out of 62 admissions in 1911 and
1912, 4, or 6.5 per cent, and in the Maryland
School, out of a total attendance in 1911 of 135,
13, or 9.2 per cent, had parents who were cousins.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Consanguineous marriages, so far as the effect
on deafness is concerned, are not of relatively frequent
occurrence. But where they do take place,
there is found a decided connection between
them and deafness, the increased tendency thus
to transmit a physical abnormality being plain.
How far, however, if at all, such deafness is
to be directly ascribed to consanguineous marriages,
is a matter for question. The main consideration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
seems to be that in such marriages
the chances are at least doubled of the offspring
acquiring the characteristics of the parents; and
that in them the liability is thus proportionately
enhanced of transmitting deafness.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>


<h4>The Deaf Having Deaf Relatives</h4>

<p>We are now to examine what traces there may
be of deafness in a family by noting what proportion
of the deaf have deaf relatives, and are to
attempt to see what may be its bearings upon the
question of heredity. In the census investigations,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
we find that out of 34,780 deaf persons
who answered, there are 10,033, or 28.8 per cent,
who have deaf relatives of some kind, direct or
collateral, 8,170, or 23.5 per cent, having deaf
brothers, sisters or ancestors. In all of these
we can without difficulty discover the influence
of heredity. In the congenitally deaf the
trace of a physical defect is even more clearly indicated.
Of these 40.1 per cent have deaf
brothers, sisters or ancestors, and 46.2 per cent
have also deaf uncles, cousins, etc.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>It is thus evident that there are certain families
in society deeply tinged with deafness, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
it sometimes passes from parent to child, from
generation to generation, and that like a cloud
it hangs over a section of the race.</p>


<h4>The Offspring of Deaf Parents</h4>

<p>All this argument leads up to one most pertinent
question: Are the statistics which we have
indicative that this deafness which passes so remorselessly
in certain families will be found all
the stronger in the children of deaf parents?
Have we ground to believe or fear that this deafness
will crop out far more surely than in the
children of parents not deaf? And can we determine
to what extent possibilities are increased of
the offspring of deaf parents being likewise deaf?</p>

<p>Let us now consider the statistics which we
have in this matter, first examining the results
of the census investigation.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Of the 8,022 married
deaf persons for whom statements are made,
we find that there are 190 who have deaf offspring,
or 2.4 per cent. Of the 4,116 deaf persons
who are married to deaf persons, 137 have deaf
children, or 3.3 per cent; and of the 3,906 deaf
persons married to hearing persons, 53 have deaf
children, or 1.4 per cent. Of the married deaf
having deaf children, 52.5 per cent have deaf relatives
of some kind, and 54.7 per cent are congenitally
deaf, the proportion of those having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
deaf relatives who are also congenitally deaf being
66.7 per cent. Of the deaf married to hearing
partners, who have deaf children, 26.4 per
cent are congenitally deaf, while 50.9 per cent
of the partners in such marriages have deaf relatives
of some kind.</p>

<p>From the census statistics, then, it appears that
the married deaf as a class do not have a large
proportion of deaf children, and that this
proportion is only a little more than twice as
great when the deaf are married to the deaf as
when they are married to the hearing. It appears
also, however, that when there are deaf relatives
involved in either kind of marriages, or
when there is congenital deafness in the deaf
parent, the effect is quite marked in the offspring.</p>

<p>Besides the census returns, we have the statistics
presented in the reports of certain schools,
which are found to point, as far as they go, to the
same conclusions. In the Kentucky School, out
of 83 pupils admitted in 1910 and 1911, there
were none the children of deaf parents, though
35, or 30.1 per cent, had deaf relatives; and out of
42 admitted in 1912 and 1913, there were 2, or
4.8 per cent, the children of deaf parents, and 12,
or 28.8 per cent, with deaf relatives. In the Iowa
School, out of 62 admissions in 1911 and 1912, 4,
or 6.5 per cent, had deaf parents, and 21, or 33.9
per cent, "defective" relatives. In the Michigan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
School, with an annual enrollment of some three
hundred, there were from 1903 to 1908 but three
children of deaf parents.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In the Colorado
School, out of a total attendance since its founding
to 1912 of 567, 3, or 0.57 per cent, were the
children of deaf parents, though 83, or 14.6 per
cent, had deaf relatives. In the Missouri School,
out of a similar attendance to 1912 of 2,174 there
were 52, or 2.4 per cent, with deaf parents,
though there were 235, or 10.8 per cent, with deaf
relatives.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The most exhaustive study of the question of
the liability of the deaf to deaf offspring is that
of Dr. E. A. Fay in his "Marriages of the Deaf"&mdash;covering
the majority of the marriages of the
deaf in America at the time it was made (1898).<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Statistical information is presented for 7,227
deaf persons and for 3,078 marriages with either
deaf or hearing partners.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> In the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
table are summarized the results of this investigation.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>It is thus seen that 9.7 per cent of the marriages
of the deaf result in deaf offspring, and
that 8.6 per cent of the children born of them are
deaf&mdash;proportions far greater than for the
the population generally.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> A striking fact to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
noted, however, is that these proportions are
greater when one parent is deaf and the other
hearing than when both are deaf. The percentage
of marriages resulting in deaf offspring
when only one parent is deaf is 12.5, and when
both are deaf, 9.2; while the percentage of deaf
children born of them when only one parent is
deaf is 9.8, and when both are deaf, 8.4. This is
apparently a very strange result, though it
probably may be accounted for in some part on
the theory that it is not so much deafness itself
that is inherited, but rather an abnormality of the
auditory organs, or a tendency to disease, of
which deafness is a result or symptom, and that
with different pathological conditions in the
parent there is less likelihood of deafness resulting.</p>

<p>The most significant part of the results seems
to be found, as before, in respect to whether or not
deaf parents are themselves congenitally deaf or
have deaf relatives. On the one hand, when one
or both of the parents are adventitiously deaf, the
percentage of marriages resulting in deaf children
is 5.6, and the percentage of deaf children is
4.2; when both parents are so, the percentages are
lower: 3.5 and 2.3. The percentages rise when
one parent is adventitiously deaf, and the other
congenitally: 8.1 and 6.5. In respect to deaf
relatives of parents, the percentages are very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
low when neither has such relatives: 2.3 and 1.2.
The lowest percentages of all are in the case
where both parents are adventitiously deaf and
neither has deaf relatives: 0.7 and 0.3.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we find the proportion of
marriages resulting in deaf offspring and the
proportion of deaf children much greater when
there is congenital deafness in one or both parents,
when one or both have deaf relatives, and
greatest of all when these influences are combined.
When one or both parents are congenitally
deaf, the percentage of marriages resulting
in deaf offspring is 13.1, and the percentage
of deaf children is 12.1; when both parents are
so, the percentages are doubled: 24.7 and 25.9.
When one parent has deaf relatives and the other
has not, the percentages are 6.6 and 6.4; when
both have, the percentages are nearly four times
as great: 23.5 and 20.9. When both parents
are congenitally deaf but neither has deaf relatives,
the percentages are 7.1 and 4.1. When
both are adventitiously deaf and both have deaf
relatives, the percentages are 17.5 and 9.6.
When both are congenitally deaf and one has
deaf relatives, the percentages are 16.3 and 20.0;
and when both have deaf relatives, the percentages
are 28.4 and 30.3.</p>

<p>The evidence is very strong, then, with regard
to the form of deafness and the presence or absence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of deaf relatives. In cases where the parents
are not congenitally deaf and have no deaf
relatives, the proportion of deaf children is very
low. When one or both parents are congenitally
deaf or have deaf relatives&mdash;when the deafness
is inherited or in the family&mdash;the likelihood becomes
far greater, and greater still when the two
influences are in conjunction. In general, in respect
to the influences of heredity upon deafness,
the main determinants seem to be found in the
existence in the parties, whether hearing or deaf,
of deaf relatives, and, to a less extent, in the existence
in parties who are deaf of congenital
deafness.</p>


<h4>Possible Action for the Prevention of Congenital
Deafness</h4>

<p>We come now to the consideration of the question
of possible action for the prevention of congenital
deafness. This examination naturally
centers about the matter of the regulation of marriage,
with due attention to the extent that action
on the part of the state is to be regarded as
desirable or feasible.</p>

<p>We have seen that congenital deafness may,
hypothetically, be divided into three distinguishable
classes: that in which consanguineous marriages
are concerned, that in which there is
antecedent deafness in the family, and that in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
which neither of these conditions occurs; and in
our inquiry it has seemed best to take up each of
these separately. It may be, however, that there
is in fact no very radical difference between these
several forms, and that with increased knowledge
on the subject a more or less intimate relation
will be found to exist.</p>

<p>Of that form of deafness in which neither consanguineous
marriages nor antecedent deafness
is involved, we are at present, as we have noted,
able to say little definitely. In most cases we may
be convinced that there exists in the parent some
peculiar state of morbidity or other affection,
latent or manifest, perhaps to some extent of
hereditary influence, which has an effect on the
organs of hearing of the offspring. A certain
proportion is quite possibly due to recognizable
defects both of physical and mental character.
Our statistical evidence, however, in respect to
this form of congenital deafness is too slight to
warrant any positive deductions; and we will
have to wait for further investigation to determine
its nature fully. None the less, marriage of
persons known to be liable to have ill effect on
possible offspring is objectionable for not a few
reasons, from the standpoint of the interests of
society; and in their reduction there will probably
be a greater or less diminution of congenital deafness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to consanguineous marriages and
their effect on deafness we are on surer ground,
so far as may be indicated by statistical data.
This question is found in very great measure to be
connected with that of deaf relatives in general.
The matter appears to be largely a part of a law
of wide application, namely, that in the blood
relationship of parents the possibilities are
intensified of the perpetuation of a certain strain,
which holds true no less with the transmission of
deafness. Consanguineous marriages are perhaps
not of sufficiently frequent occurrence, so
far as concerns the effect on deafness, to
require special action; but in the consideration of
such marriages in general, their part in the
causation of deafness should have due weight;
and whatever may be said regarding them in
other relations, they are to be avoided if we wish
to remove all chances of this kind of deafness
resulting.</p>

<p>The problem of deaf relatives and their connection
with congenital deafness is a very large
one. Attention however, has mostly been focused
upon it in relation to the intermarriage of
the deaf and its effect upon their offspring. Indeed,
in such unions there has already been more
or less concern, and there has even been question
whether it is a wise or unwise policy to allow the
deaf to marry other deaf persons. The deaf, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
we shall discover, not only find their companions
for social intercourse among similar deaf persons,
but <i>a fortiori</i> very often seek such persons for
their partners in marriage&mdash;in fact, more often
than they do hearing partners, nearly three-fourths
of the married deaf being married to deaf
partners.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Not only has it been feared that the
offspring of such marriages might likewise be
deaf, but there has also been apprehension lest in
their encouragement there might result a deaf
species of the race.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>From our discussion, however, we have found
that in most of the marriages of the deaf we have
but small reason for disquiet. If deafness in the
parent is really adventitious, there is little possibility
of its passing on to the offspring. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the deafness in the parent is itself congenital, the
situation becomes more serious. If in such case
there is no added risk from the existence of deaf
relatives, the likelihood of transmitting deafness
need not always be a matter of deep concern,
though the hazard is materially larger than for
adventitious deafness. When there are deaf relatives
involved, the peril, made stronger if coupled
with congenital deafness, is most pronounced;
and, indeed, the existence of collateral deafness
seems a more certain sign of warning than direct
heredity itself. Finally, even in the marriage of
the deaf with the hearing, the dangers are not in
fact lessened if conditions otherwise unchanged
are attendant.</p>

<p>What action should be taken in respect to that
part of the deaf who may marry under conditions
favorable to the production of deaf offspring is
not at present clear. Legislation would not appear
on the whole to be advisable;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and the exertion
of moral suasion, so far as possible, in the
individual cases concerned would seem a more
acceptable course. The matter, however, really
belongs in the province of eugenics, and we will
probably do best to await the authoritative pronouncement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of its decrees before full procedure is
resolved upon.</p>


<h4>Congenital Deafness as an Increasing or Decreasing
Phenomenon</h4>

<p>The final matter to be ascertained in respect to
congenital deafness is whether it is relatively increasing
or decreasing. The following table
will show the number of the congenitally deaf in
the censuses of 1880, 1890, and 1900, with their
respective percentages and the ratios per million
of population.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p class="hdtab">NUMBER OF THE CONGENITALLY DEAF IN 1880, 1890,
AND 1900</p>


<div class='center'>

</table></div>


<p>From this it appears that congenital deafness is
decreasing both in relation to all deafness, and to
the general population.</p>

<p>For further statistics, we may revert to our
tables under adventitious deafness. In the tables
relating to periods of successive recent years we
find in respect to three schools, the New York
and Western Pennsylvania institutions and the
Maryland School, with certain fluctuations, no
great change on the whole, though the last named
school shows still a very high proportion. In two
schools, the Michigan and Wisconsin, rather an
increase is observed. In the Pennsylvania Institution,
which covers a period of seventy years,
there is a decrease from over 50 per cent to less
than 40.</p>

<p>A better test perhaps lies in the comparison of
the proportions found for congenital deafness in
the tables relating to periods widely separated in
time. In these an increase is seen in the single
case of the Ohio School; while a decrease is
apparent in three, namely, the American and
Iowa schools and the New York Institution.
These decreases in percentages are respectively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
from 44.8 and 50.1 to 35.2; from 37.2 to 26.9;
and from 42.9 to 38.0.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>From the evidence that we have, then, taken
together, it seems reasonable to conclude that congenital
deafness is, though slowly, becoming less
in the course of the years.</p>


<h4>Conclusions with Respect to the Elimination or
Prevention of Deafness</h4>

<p>Most of what has been said in this chapter with
respect to the elimination or prevention of deafness
may be summed up as follows:</p>

<p>1. There are two kinds of deafness&mdash;adventitious
and congenital. Of the total number of
cases adventitious deafness comprises nearly two-thirds,
and congenital deafness a little over one-third.</p>

<p>2. Nearly all adventitious deafness is caused
by some disease of infancy or childhood attacking
the middle or internal ear, a large part being of
infectious character. The two chief diseases
causing such deafness are scarlet fever and meningitis,
with a less amount from brain fever, typhoid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
fever, measles, catarrh, diphtheria, whooping
cough, etc.</p>

<p>3. A considerable part of this deafness is preventable
under enlightened action. Medical science
is principally in control of the situation, but
there is also much that can be done in general
measures for the protection of the health. In
attacking the problem, the most immediate
practical program lies in the arrest of those
diseases, especially infantile and infectious diseases,
that cause deafness.</p>

<p>4. Our evidence is incomplete to determine
definitely whether adventitious deafness is increasing
or decreasing relatively among the population;
but it is hardly other than likely that it is
decreasing. Although certain diseases producing
deafness fail to show any extensive signs of abatement,
there are other diseases from which there
can be little doubt that deafness is decreasing.</p>

<p>5. In the outlook there is, on the whole, promise,
both in respect to the treatment of deafness
itself and of the diseases that lead to deafness,
though it cannot be said in any sense that any
large or general relief is at present in sight.</p>

<p>6. Of congenital deafness nearly half occurs
in families often without any positively known
strain to indicate a predisposition to deafness.
Though concerning this deafness little in the
present state of our knowledge can be predicated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
it is likely that with measures to secure a race
sound in all particulars there will be a reduction
to a greater or less extent of such deafness.</p>

<p>7. Consanguineous marriages do not take
place, so far as deafness as an effect is concerned,
to any great extent; though where they do the
consequences are very marked. Their relation to
deafness consists apparently for the greatest part
in the fact that the chances of its transmission
are thereby intensified, there being also a very
strong connection with the question of deaf relatives
in general.</p>

<p>8. There are a certain number of families in
society deeply tainted with deafness, in evidence
both lineally and collaterally, and this deafness
may be transmitted from parent to offspring.</p>

<p>9. Children of deaf parents are far more likely
to be deaf than children of hearing parents.</p>

<p>10. The great majority of the children of deaf
parents, however, are able to hear, the proportion
of those who are not being small.</p>

<p>11. The likelihood of deaf offspring is not
necessarily greater when both parents are deaf
than when one is deaf and the other hearing.</p>

<p>12. The liability to deaf offspring depends in
the greatest degree upon the presence or absence
in the parents, deaf or hearing, of deaf relatives,
and, to a less extent, upon whether or not the
existing deafness is congenital&mdash;being especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
great under a combination of these two conditions.</p>

<p>13. Action in respect to marriages of the deaf
likely to result in deaf offspring seems for the
present rather to be limited to moral forces.</p>

<p>14. Congenital deafness appears, from all the
evidence, to be decreasing relatively among the
population, though probably only at a very slow
rate.</p>

<p>15. Finally, with respect to our original inquiry,
it is to be said that there are no indications
that deafness will disappear from the human
race within any time which we can measure; and
hence that the deaf are to be in society not
only for a season, but for a period apparently as
yet indefinite. Nevertheless the situation is not
without encouragement. From the data in our
possession regarding deafness as a whole, it seems
certain that deafness is not on the increase relatively
among the population. From our knowledge
concerning adventitious deafness, the probabilities
are that, if anything, it is decreasing;
while the evidence as to congenital deafness is that
it is decreasing. It is likely, then, that deafness in
general is tending to decrease; and we are thus
justified in believing that the number of the deaf
will in time become less.</p>

than former, with a consequent discovery of a larger

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> Letters of inquiry as to whether or not "total" deafness
appeared to be decreasing were sent by the writer to the professors
of diseases of the ear of the medical schools of Johns
Hopkins University, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University,
Cornell University, Harvard University, University of
Chicago, Northwestern University, University of Michigan, and
the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia. The opinion of
four of these is that such deafness is clearly decreasing; of
three that little or no decrease is apparent; while by two no
opinion can be vouched yet. The greatest encouragement is
found in respect to treatment for middle ear affections and infections
from fevers. By Dr. S. MacCuen Smith, of the Jefferson
Medical College, it is believed that there is a decrease,
"largely due to the fact that not only the general medical
profession, but the public at large, are recognizing the
importance of having the minor aural lesions promptly and
properly cared for. This being the case, it is no longer possible
for children in the public schools to continue their studies
when suffering from diseased tonsils and enlarged adenoid
vegetations. From this cause alone, many cases of impairment
of hearing which usually occur later in life will be prevented
in the future". By Dr. E. A. Crockett, of Harvard
University, it is believed that, although there is a larger
amount of deafness from measles, there is less, not only from
scarlet fever, but also from chronic suppurations, from adenoid
and throat troubles in general, and even from meningitis,
owing to the use of serums. Regarding his own observations,
within a period of twenty-five years "the number of extremely
deaf persons and deaf-mutes has very materially diminished".</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Hereditary deafness is sometimes of a kind that manifests
itself some years after birth, often with certain relatives
similarly affected. This is especially true of catarrhal and
middle ear affections, though their results may more often be
partial rather than total deafness.</p></div>

pupils to the extent that the institutions do, thus leaving a

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>TREATMENT OF THE DEAF BY THE STATE</h3>


<h4>General Attitude of the Law towards the Deaf</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">After</span> examination of the question of how
long the deaf are to be an element of the
population, our discussion turns to their
position at present as an actual part of society.
The first relation to be considered is that of the
state to them.</p>

<p>The state acts on men through the law, and in
the law is represented not only its authority, but
its attitude as well towards the problems that
confront society, including the treatment of the
various elements of its population. In this
chapter it is our purpose by a study of the law
in respect to the deaf to discover the attitude of
the state towards them and the treatment which
it has accorded them.</p>

<p>Generally in ancient and even in more modern
days the deaf, especially the congenitally deaf
without education, have been held in the eyes of
the law more or less as though they were an
abnormal element in the state, at times being regarded
as though they were of defective minds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and now and then being considered practically as
idiots. Though there was usually meditated no
unduly harsh treatment of the deaf, they were
for the most part deemed incapable of performing
the full duties of citizenship, certain of the rights
that belonged to their fellowmen were denied to
them, and they were held in considerable degree
in what amounted to legal bondage. It was only
in the course of time in most countries that the law
came to look upon the deaf differently, to regard
them more as normal persons, and to grant them
in greater measure the rights of other men.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>In America the attention of the law has been
directed to the deaf both by legislation relating
to them, and by court decisions affecting them.
In addition, in the constitutions of a number
of states, as we shall see, provision is made for
institutions for the education of the deaf; and
in one state, Mississippi,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> a provision is found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
exempting the deaf from the payment of a
poll tax. The law cannot be said to have concerned
itself extensively with the deaf, but the
light in which they have been viewed has been
indicated fairly clearly. Judicial <i>dicta</i> and
opinions have been of less frequency and importance
than legislation, and have rather dealt
with the mental capacity of the deaf in certain
legal relations and proceedings, as in their responsibility
for crimes, the making of wills, the
appointment of interpreters, etc. Legislation itself
has not often been engaged in providing for
the deaf as a special class, beyond maintaining
schools for the education of the young. Where
this legislation has taken place, it may be said to
be of three kinds. First, the deaf have been regarded
as mentally deficient or incapable of certain
civic acts, and discriminatory laws have been
enacted. Next, the deaf have been thought to
need special consideration or protection on the
part of the state, and laws have been passed for
the appointment of guardians or otherwise for
their security or benefit. The third class of
legislation is where the state bases its action upon
the supposed weakness of the deaf, their "physical
disability," as it is frequently termed, and
here we have a series of what may be called
negative benefactions, designed to make less hard
the way of the deaf. Such special provision has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
consisted chiefly in the remission of taxes in certain
instances or of some other form of more or
less direct assistance.</p>


<h4>Legislation Discriminatory respecting the Deaf</h4>

<p>Legislation which may be termed discriminatory
in respect to the deaf has really been of
but slight extent.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> In Georgia we find an enactment
of 1840,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> in which the deaf were to be regarded
<i>pro tanto</i> as idiots, so far as concerned
the managing of their estates, though this was
in fact intended for their protection. In New
Mexico a law has been enacted, forbidding those
deaf by birth from making wills, unless their intention
is declared in writing;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and in Louisiana
a deaf man is incapable of acting as a witness to
a testament.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> In several states, as New York
and Massachusetts, there have been enactments
in regard to deaf-mute immigrants together with
other classes who might be likely to become a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
public charge, with the exaction of bond as
security.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> In Georgia<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> there is an enactment in
reference to various itinerant concerns which
might leave deaf persons, as well as others, in the
state as public charges.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>


<h4>Legislation in Protection of the Deaf</h4>

<p>Legislation of the second class, where the deaf
are thought to require particular consideration
or protection, has likewise been infrequent. The
first instance is an enactment of Massachusetts
in 1776,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> relating to the appointment, on certain
occasions, of guardians for the deaf, especially
those deaf "from their nativity," together with
other persons&mdash;which is probably the earliest
statutory reference to the deaf in America. A
later example is an enactment in Georgia in
1818,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and still in force, providing for the appointment
of guardians, on somewhat the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
order as that which we have indicated, for deaf
and dumb persons incapable of managing their
estates. In New Jersey in 1838<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> a law was
enacted, forbidding deaf persons under seventeen
years of age to be bound out as apprentices.
In Ohio a statute also of 1838<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> provided
for guardians for the deaf, and several modern
statutes are somewhat of this nature. In Maine
the deaf cannot be sent to the reform school.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
In Arkansas<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and Missouri<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> it is provided that
the court may appoint guardians for deaf persons
from fourteen to twenty-one years of age in case
of the death of a parent. Of somewhat different
character, but still for the protection of the deaf,
is the enactment in several states, as Wisconsin<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
and Virginia,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> where injury or abuse of the deaf
is made a matter of special attention in the law.</p>


<h4>Legislation in Aid of the Deaf</h4>

<p>Examples of legislation designed to be of
material aid to the deaf are rather more common,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the chief of which, as we have noted, is the exemption
from the payment of some personal or property
tax.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Thus in Missouri we find a statute of
1843<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> allowing a deaf man to be exempt from
the poll tax and the tax on property up to $300.
Indiana in 1848<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> exempted its deaf and blind
citizens from a poll tax and a property tax up to
$500. Mississippi<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> exempted these classes from
the road duty in 1878, and two years later from
the poll tax as well, this exemption being incorporated
in the state constitution, as we have seen.
Tennessee<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> in 1895 also exempted from the
poll tax the deaf, the blind and those incapable of
labor. In Pennsylvania legislation seems to have
gone the furthest in its desire to be of material
help to the deaf, for here we find the deaf with
the blind exempted from the penalties which
usually apply to tramps.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Such are instances
of this form of legislation, but similar legislation
has been enacted in other states.</p>

<p>Very rare are instances where the state makes
special provision for the care of, or extends
special poor relief to, any of its deaf population.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
The chief example seems to be the action of some
of the New England states with their so-called
"missions for the deaf." These are associations,
composed in great part of the deaf and engaged
in various forms of mission work, and to them
state funds are granted to aid the aged, infirm
and helpless deaf. By this plan Maine is said to
have been without a deaf-mute pauper in ten
years. The amounts allowed, however, for this
purpose are not large, being $200 a year in Maine
and $150 in New Hampshire.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In Ohio the
counties are allowed to contract with private
homes for the maintenance of the aged and infirm
deaf&mdash;there being but one such in the state, that
supported by the deaf themselves&mdash;and the state
board of charities is given power to remove
deaf persons thereto from the county infirmaries.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Instances are likewise rare where the state
makes a distinct appropriation of money for the
benefit of the deaf other than for schools. We
have one instance in New York where the state
for a certain number of years allowed a small sum
to the publishers of a paper for the benefit of
poor deaf-mutes.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>As a last species of legislation in aid of the
deaf, we have a single enactment of quite different
character from that which we have hitherto
found, and of later appearance. This is the law
enacted in Minnesota in 1913,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> which provides
for a division for the deaf in the state bureau of
labor. Its duties are to</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Collect statistics of the deaf, ascertain what trades
or occupations are most suitable for them and best
adapted to promote their interests, ... use [its]
best efforts to aid them in securing such employment
as they may be best fitted to engage in, keep a census
and obtain facts, information and statistics as to their
condition in life with a view to the betterment of their
lot, and endeavor to obtain statistics and information
of the conditions of labor and employment and education
in other states with a view to promoting the general
welfare of the deaf in this state.</p></div>

<p>Such legislation may prove highly beneficial to
the deaf, not only in rendering very desirable aid
to them, but also in offering means of learning
very important facts as to their condition.</p>


<h4>Tenor of Court Decisions Affecting the Deaf</h4>

<p>The opinions of the courts of law in regard to
the deaf have, as we have noted, rather revolved
upon the mental capacity of the deaf in certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
proceedings, and upon their competence in certain
legal relations. These judicial expressions
have in the main referred to four relations of the
deaf in the law: 1. in their responsibility for
crime; 2. in acting as witnesses; 3. in requiring
guardians; and 4. in the making of wills and
contracts generally.</p>

<p>As to the responsibility of the deaf man for his
misdeeds, there has been in times past more or
less presumption against it, especially if he were
born deaf and were without education; but to-day
he is quite generally held fully answerable for
his crimes and misdemeanors, and his deafness
cannot mitigate his punishment.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> As a witness,
the deaf man under proper circumstances is now
allowed to appear without hindrance before
virtually any court.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> As to special guardians,
these will be accorded the deaf when there appears
sufficient need, though there is less of this
than formerly.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> With respect to the testamentary
capacity of the deaf, we find that in
times past the deaf were often said to be more
or less incapable of making wills, though this presumption<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
could always be overcome. Naturally
their wills were subjected to considerable scrutiny
for the purpose of preventing fraud; but if
written and apparently genuine, they could
usually stand. To-day the deaf are practically
everywhere held to be quite capable in this
respect, and probably nowhere would a will be
set aside for reason of the deafness of the testator
alone. Likewise the deaf are now generally held
capable of entering into all contractual relations.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>


<h4>Present Trend of the Law in Respect to the Deaf</h4>

<p>In most of the statutes and decisions to which
we have referred there appears a distinct trend
towards treating the deaf quite as normal persons,
and the tendency may be considered to be
general to-day to hold them very much as other
citizens. The greater part of all the special legislation
has ceased of late years, and it is seldom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
now that a particular enactment is placed upon
the statute books. Where such does occur, it
arises chiefly where some peculiar protection of
the deaf has been felt to be needed. Discriminatory
legislation has practically disappeared, as
has also beneficial legislation of the old sort, the
only kind likely to be enacted in the future being
along the new lines pointed out.</p>

<p>In judicial proceedings likewise particular
usage in respect to the deaf has almost entirely
passed away, and the deaf to-day receive little
distinctive treatment. Practically the sole special
consideration now accorded them is in the procurement
of interpreters for proper occasions.
On the whole, then, the present attitude of the law
may be said to be to regard the deaf more and
more fully as citizens, to allow them all the rights
and duties of such, and to consider them in little
need of particular aid or attention.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_61_61" id="Footnote_61_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> The legal treatment of the deaf, however, in past times has
not been as severe as has been often supposed. Both the
Justinian Code and the Civil Law, as well as the Common Law,
granted a number of rights to the deaf, these being in some
cases as far as the policy of the law would permit. In a few
instances a not unsympathetic attitude was displayed towards
them. In the early Roman law and in some other systems
word of mouth was necessary to accomplish certain legal acts,
and this of course bore hardly upon the deaf. In all cases it
was the deaf-mute from birth who suffered most. On this subject,
see A. C. Gaw, "The Legal Status of the Deaf," 1907;
H. P. Peet, "Legal Rights and Responsibilities of the Deaf,"
1857 (Proceedings of Convention of American Instructors, iv.,

York case in 1820, it was said by Chancellor Kent that the
deaf and dumb were considered <i>prima facie</i> as insane, incapable
of making a will and fit subjects for guardianship, by
the civil law. The presumption was due, he said, to the fact
that "want of hearing and speech exceedingly cramps the
powers of the mind," but it was to be overcome by proof.
In this case the presumption was overruled. The implication,
however, never applied to the deaf not born so. At present
there is no presumption in connection with wills, deeds, witnessing,
or guardianship. See 3 Conn., 299; 27 Gratt. (Va.),
190; 6 Ga., 324; 3 Ired. (N. C.), 535. In the Missouri case,

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>ECONOMIC CONDITION OF THE DEAF</h3>


<h4>Extent to Which the Deaf are a Wage-earning
and Self-supporting Element of the
Population</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the want of the sense of hearing, and with
it oftentimes the faculty of speech, the deaf
are deprived of most important powers, and,
it might appear, of an essential equipment for
work among men. It is not to be denied that
the deaf start out into life severely handicapped,
nor can the difficulties which they must face in
meeting the world pass unregarded.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding the particular adversity
under which the deaf have to labor, they remain
in full possession of all their other physical forces,
and it may be a question whether on the whole
they are to be considered disqualified from engaging
in the industrial pursuits of men. It may be
that there are occupations in which their deafness
will not prove of material consequence, and
that in such fields they will be able to enter without
serious impediment. In the present chapter
we shall attempt to see how far these possibilities
seem to be realized in the actual industrial life of
the community. In other words, we shall consider<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
what is the place of the deaf as economic factors
in this life, and how far they are independent
wage-earners, at the same time comparing their
economic standing with that of the general population.</p>

<p>The returns of the census, covering the entire
country and presenting the results of a careful
investigation, will furnish our most complete
source of information. Here<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> are reported in
gainful occupations 12,678 deaf persons over ten
years of age, or 38.1 per cent of the number of
the deaf over this age.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> This is somewhat less
than the percentage for the general population,
which is 50.2. Of the deaf twenty years of age
and over, however, the percentage gainfully employed
is 50.1, embracing 11,670 persons. In the
following table is shown the number of the deaf
over ten years of age in the five great occupations,
with the respective percentages, and also
the percentages for the general population.</p>

<p class="hdtab">GENERAL OCCUPATIONS OF THE DEAF</p>


<div class='center'>
<table class="tab1" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdc1">Occupation</td><td class="tdc1">Number</td><td class="tdc1">Per<br />cent</td><td class="tdc1">Per cent of<br />General<br />Population</td></tr>

</table></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>It is seen from this that the proportions are very
nearly the same for the deaf and the general
population in agricultural pursuits, domestic and
personal service, and professional service. In
manufacturing and mechanical occupations the
proportion of the deaf is indeed considerably
higher. In trade and transportation, on the other
hand, the proportion for the deaf is far lower
than that for the general population&mdash;a condition
to be accounted for by the very evident need of
hearing in such pursuits.</p>

<p>Of the deaf engaged in agricultural pursuits,
3,366, or about three-fourths, are in a position of
ownership or direction, being farmers, planters,
or overseers; 1,218 are agricultural laborers,
while 75 are gardeners, florists, or nursery-men.
The large number of the deaf in professional
occupations is in part explained by the fact
that 206 are themselves engaged in the instruction
of the deaf. Other specified occupations
where fifty or more of the deaf are employed in
each are as follows:</p>

<p>So far, then, as appears from the findings of
the United States census, the deaf are seen to be
distributed among the chief industries very generally,
and in very many of what are known as
"trades" they are able to be profitably employed.
In some activities of life deafness is of course an
effectual barrier, but these are rather restricted
ones. There is but one great division of employment
in which the deaf cannot enter extensively,
namely, commercial and mercantile pursuits.
With these exceptions, the deaf are found to be
industrially occupied like the rest of the community,
and to be able to engage, and actually
engaging, in most of the employments of men.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>In respect to the general economic status of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the deaf, a second source of information, at the
bottom of the scale, as it were, is to be found in
the proportion of the deaf cared for in public
alms-houses. Though a much greater proportion
of the deaf are discovered here than of the general
population, the deaf do not on the whole constitute
a large part of the alms-house population
of the country. In 1910 the census reported 540
deaf-mutes to be in alms-houses, or six-tenths of
one per cent of all their inmates.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> That is to
say, a little over one per cent (1.2) of the total
number of the deaf in the United States are
found to-day in alms-houses.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Such is the evidence we have in respect to the
economic standing of the deaf. Yet the fact
that the deaf are usually found capable of taking
care of themselves should not be, after all, a matter
either of doubt or of wonder. They are for
the most part, as we have indicated, quite "able-bodied,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and but for their want of hearing are
perfectly normal in respect to "doing a job." If
they are skillful and efficient, their deafness
proves comparatively little of a drawback. Another
contributing cause in the situation lies in the
fact that most of the deaf have attended the
special schools provided for them, where industrial
preparation with the opportunity to
learn a trade is offered and largely availed of.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
When they go out into the world, they may be
supposed to have an industrial equipment, which,
besides taking in view their handicap, is one in
many respects fully equal to that of their hearing
fellow-laborers; and though many of the deaf,
apparently the greater number, do not follow the
trade learned at school, yet there is no doubt that
the training and lessons in industry there acquired
prove of decided practical advantage.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<h4>Views of the Deaf as to their Economic Standing</h4>

<p>To what extent the deaf hold themselves able
to stand alongside the general population may
well be indicated by what they themselves have
to say. Of the adult deaf who have had schooling,
it is claimed that eighty-one per cent
are gainfully employed;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and that of the adult
male deaf ninety per cent are self-supporting.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
A large proportion are said to be the heads of
families and the possessors of homes.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In respect
to the conditions of their employment, including
that of wages, they are usually ready to
declare that they are little different from those
of the general population, sometimes taking pains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to point out the substantial equality of the
two.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The views of the deaf in the whole matter of
their industrial footing may be expressed as
summed up in the following resolutions, which
were reported by a special committee on industrial
conditions of the deaf at the convention of
the National Association of the Deaf in 1904:<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. There are few ordinary occupations in which the
deaf do not or cannot engage.</p>

<p>2. Employers and foremen treat deaf workmen as
they do hearing workmen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Deafness is a hindrance to a great extent, but it is
not such a formidable barrier as has popularly been
supposed.</p>

<p>4. The deaf workman usually has steady work.
Those that do not generally have only themselves to
blame.</p>

<p>5. The deaf invariably get the same wages for the
same class of work as the hearing.</p>

<p>6. Employers and foremen are glad to have deaf
workmen who can show that they have the ability to do
the work expected of them, and take them on a basis
equal to that of the hearing. If they are competent,
their services secure ready recognition.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p></div>


<h4>The Deaf as Alms-seekers</h4>

<p>It might be thought that the deaf might sometimes
find their infirmity a useful means of
soliciting alms from the public. But it is gratifying
to learn that very few of them ever try to
make capital out of their affliction. That a deaf
man merely as such is in no wise to be considered
a special beneficiary of charity is a principle
spiritedly endorsed by nearly all the deaf themselves;
and they are found to be the last to lend
encouragement to any appeals for aid from the
charitably disposed.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, it is a fact, perhaps not as
widely known as it should be, that there are persons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
able to hear who often pretend to be deaf
and dumb in order to work on the sensibilities of
the public. To such appeals a far more ready
response is met with than should be the case. The
deaf themselves usually do what they can to prevent
this, a certain number indeed going to considerable
lengths in this direction, and not infrequently
running such impostors down.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> In
nearly all the state associations of the deaf as well
as in the national organization it is made a
particular object to investigate and prosecute
mendicants simulating deafness, while in their
papers a vigorous war is being waged.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> At the
same time by many of the deaf a campaign of
education is being conducted for the enlightenment
of the public. The following resolutions,
adopted by the National Association of the Deaf
in 1910, attest their feeling in the matter:<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p><i>Whereas</i>, There is no necessity for an educated deaf
person to beg or solicit alms on account of deafness;
and</p>

<p><i>Whereas</i>, There are many cases of persons who are
not really deaf, but hearing people, who prey on the
sympathy of the public to the injury of the respectable
and self-supporting deaf; therefore be it</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That it is the sense of the Association that
stringent laws should be enacted, making it a penal
offense to ask pecuniary aid on account of deafness or
on pretense of being "deaf and dumb."</p></div>

<p>Only very rarely, however, has legal cognizance
been taken of this evil, though it may sometimes
be included under the general charge of
"vagrancy" or "imposture." In a few states
there have been special enactments, as in New
York<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and Minnesota,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> in the former the impersonation
of a deaf man being expressly added
to the offenses that constitute imposture, and in
the latter to those that constitute vagrancy.</p>


<h4>Homes for the Deaf</h4>

<p>Homes for the deaf in America have never
been organized on other than a small scale, and
in the main they may be said to serve a purpose
similar to that of homes for the aged and infirm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
generally. Though there is little call for such
establishments to a wide extent, and though the
proportion of the deaf to be benefited by them
is small,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> yet for a number of the deaf there is
a peculiar need. These are deaf persons, usually
the old and decrepit, who are without means
to support themselves, and have no family or
friends to look to for help. To them a special
retreat in association with others in similar condition
proves an immeasurable blessing, and in
such their last years may be spent in tranquillity
and comparative happiness.</p>

<p>The object of a home for the deaf is thus given
for one of them.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To take care of such of the deaf of the state as are incapacitated
by reason of old age or other infirmity from
taking care of themselves, to the end that they may have
the comforts of a home, where they can associate with
each other, and have the consolation of religious services
in their own language of signs, instead of being sent to a
county infirmary.</p></div>

<p>The purpose of another home is thus described:<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>This home is unique, being the only institution of its
kind in the state, owned and controlled by the deaf, who
have formed themselves into an association, known as
the Pennsylvania Society for the Advancement of the
Deaf. Like our Ohio cousins, who have already
established a similar home, we pride ourselves upon our
ability to own and control such a responsible institution.
The home owes its existence entirely to the charitable
impulse of the deaf themselves, aided by the generosity
of their hearing friends. It exists because of the desire
to provide a home of rest for the infirm of our class
during their declining years, so that they may find here
comfort and happiness in congenial companionship and
intelligent conversation.</p></div>

<p>At present there are five homes for the deaf.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
They are found in the states of Massachusetts,
New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, there being
two in New York.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The first to be created was
the Gallaudet Home at Wappinger's Falls, New
York, founded in 1885; the second the Ohio
Home at Westerville in 1896; the third the home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
of St. Elizabeth's Industrial School in New York
City in 1897; the fourth the New England Home
at Everett, Massachusetts, in 1901;<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and the fifth
the Pennsylvania Home at Doyleston in 1902.
The homes in Ohio and Pennsylvania are owned
and controlled by the societies for the deaf in
these respective states, the management being in
the hands of trustees, in the former of twenty,
and in the latter of nine. The Gallaudet Home is
under the Church Mission to Deaf-Mutes of the
Protestant Episcopal Church, with the direction
vested in a board of twenty-five trustees. The
home in Massachusetts is controlled by a private
society organized for the purpose, with a board
of fifteen trustees in charge. The home in New
York City is a part of St. Elizabeth's Industrial
School of the Roman Catholic Church.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>The homes are for the most part for the deaf
of restricted areas, those in Pennsylvania and
Ohio being for the deaf in these respective states.
With but one exception,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> they are open to the
"aged and infirm," in some there being an age
limitation of sixty years. The homes are in general
free to those qualified to enter, and though
a charge may be exacted from persons able to
pay, this is seldom done, the homes being intended
for the destitute and friendless.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>The total number of inmates in the homes is
106, ranging in different ones from 13 to 30, and
averaging about 20. The total annual cost of
maintenance is $30,190, making the average cost
of each inmate $290.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The value of the property
of the homes is about $375,000, one home having
two-thirds of this, and two homes four-fifths.</p>

<p>As little is received in the way of pay from
inmates,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> the homes have to depend for the most
part upon private benevolence for their support.
In the case of the Ohio and Pennsylvania homes
this support comes largely from the deaf themselves.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
In nearly all the homes there are a certain
number of inmates, but usually a very small
number, cared for at public expense. Private
contributions to the homes are seldom large,
though in one case these have amounted to a considerable
sum.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> They usually range from three
or four thousand dollars a year to several times as
much.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<h4>Conclusions with Respect to the Economic Position
of the Deaf</h4>

<p>From all the foregoing we may conclude the
following with respect to the economic position
of the deaf:</p>

<p>1. The deaf are not a burden upon the community.</p>

<p>2. They are wage-earners in a degree that
compares well with the general population.</p>

<p>3. The occupations open to them and in which
they are successfully employed are much larger
in number than is generally thought, and in
many their infirmity is very little of a drawback.</p>

<p>4. The deaf hold themselves on an economic
equality with the rest of their fellow-citizens, and
ask no alms or favors of any kind.</p>

<p>5. Beyond homes for certain of the aged and
infirm, which are called for in not a few quarters,
the deaf stand in need of little distinctive
economic treatment from society.</p>

there have been not a few inventors. In the civil service of the
National government there are said to be nearly two score.
In 1908 an order was issued by the Civil Service Commission,
debarring deaf persons from this service. So great was the
protest, however, made by the deaf and their friends that the
decision was reversed by the President, and the deaf were allowed
to compete for any position where their deafness would
not interfere. See <i>Annals</i>, liii., 1908, p. 249; liv., 1909, p. 387;

of the highest praise, and speaks volumes for them. The real
cause for wonder, however, is that the public should ever
allow itself to be deceived by those asking alms on the pretexts
given. By no disease known to medical science, save paralysis
alone, can a man lose his speech and hearing at one and the
same time. It may be safely estimated that of such gentry 98,
perhaps 100, per cent are rank frauds.</p></div>

taken seriously. One was by a deaf man in 1860 in the form
of a memorial to Congress for the creation of a deaf-mute
commonwealth. See <i>Annals</i>, viii., 1856, p. 118; x., 1858, pp.

Farm colonies on a small scale for poor deaf-mutes have also
been considered occasionally, but little further has ever been
attempted. See <i>Deaf-Mutes' Journal</i>, Aug. 8, 1912; Sept. 12,

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE DEAF</h3>


<h4>Social Cleavage from the General Population</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> preceding chapter has dealt with the
economic possibilities of the deaf, and the
extent to which they stand alongside the
population generally. The other side of the
shield in relation of the deaf to society is now to
be presented, that is, how far their want of hearing
will count in their participation in the social
life of the community.</p>

<p>While the deaf man may be an active component
in the economic and industrial life of
society, yet his inability to hear and his frequently
consequent inability to speak stand in the way
of his prompt and continuous partaking in its
social life. He may, and does, have many friends
among his neighbors and acquaintances, but in
the discourse between man and man which forms
such a large part of the interest and delight in
living, he is unable to join. There is usually at
hand no ready and rapid means of communication
as there is between two hearing persons in
conversation, and his intercourse must necessarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
be slow and tedious. The privileges of his church
he cannot enjoy; in his lodge he misses the fellowship
which is one of its fundamental ends; in
few forms of convivial entertainment can he take
part. Thus seeking an outlet for those social instincts
which charge through his being, the deaf
man finds himself among men, but as though surrounded
by a great impenetrable wall against
which their voices break in vain.</p>

<p>Placed, however, with his deaf fellows, he discovers
himself in a different situation. He soon
learns that by the use of that language of signs so
largely employed by other deaf men, and of which
he in a short time becomes master, he is able to
converse with an ease and quickness fully as great
as by that means of which he has been deprived.
Hence he ceases in large measure to carry on his
social intercourse with the hearing, and turns to
his deaf comrades; in them he builds up an approximately
congenial companionship and fellowship,
and to them he looks largely for his means
of social diversion. With them he feels a close
bond of sympathy, and is moved to co-operate
with them, and to stand with them when their
mutual interests are concerned. In time associations
in various forms come to be organized
among them. In such wise is realized the desire
of the deaf as of all men to commune with their
fellows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<h4>Desirability of Organizations Composed of the
Deaf</h4>

<p>By some people societies or organizations composed
exclusively of the deaf have been opposed,
or at least looked upon with disfavor. This is
because it has been felt that it is not well for the
deaf to form a class apart in the community, and
that unless discouraged the practice will cause
intermarriage among the deaf, which may result
in an increasing number of deaf people&mdash;a matter
to which we have already given attention.</p>

<p>But in combating this tendency of the deaf
to organize among themselves, we are really unmindful
of an elemental sociological principle,
that like-minded persons are prone to congregate,
and will seek to form purposive societies
and associations, exemplified as well in a boys'
athletic club, in a church sewing circle, in a lodge
of free and accepted masons, as in a "league of
elect surds."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> If "clannishness" is the outcome,
it must be accepted only as the necessary consequence
of the infirmity of the deaf, in the practical
affairs of life such men being bound to seek
out and associate with others of like condition.
By the deaf themselves it is claimed that the
good readily outweighs the possible evils, and
that, as the fact of their deafness forbids them
belonging generally to societies for the hearing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they are thus forced to band together, or almost
entirely to go without the social amalgamations
which form such a conspicuous and valuable part
of life.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>


<h4>Purposes, Activities and Extent of Such
Organizations</h4>

<p>The organizations of the deaf are of several
kinds: termed clubs, leagues, societies, associations
and the like; and wherever a number of deaf
persons are congregated, some such organization
is likely to be effected.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> In large cities not a few
may be found, planned perhaps on different lines
or appealing to different kinds of people. The
majority of the societies are formed for the
mutual pleasure and culture of the members.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
part are organized on fraternal principles, some
with benefit features, paying out so much in case
of illness and the like; while in a few a certain
amount of relief may be dispensed to those discovered
to be in need. In most of the societies,
as with the body of the deaf generally, there is
a considerable amount of solidarity, and the members
are usually quick to act in a common cause
or to apply the principle that the concern of one
is the concern of all.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>While these societies of the deaf are usually
local in their composition, there exists more or
less communication with bodies in other cities and
communities. In over a fourth of the states there
are state societies, while in most of the states
there are also alumni associations of the special
schools, which are of state-wide extent.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> A national<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
body is likewise in existence, the National
Association of the Deaf, founded in 1880, and incorporated
in 1900; and there is a National
Fraternal Society of the Deaf, with benefits for
sickness, injury and death, which has many local
branches, this being probably the largest organization
of the deaf in the country.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> An international
organization has also been formed, known
as the World's Congress of the Deaf.</p>

<p>Among the various associations of the deaf,
particular mention may be made of church organizations
in some of the larger cities and towns,
which not infrequently serve in some measure the
purpose of a social center. These deaf congregations
are usually in communion with some denominational
body, often being the result of church
"missions" to the deaf, and are ministered to
regularly or at stated times by clergymen, most
of whom are themselves deaf. For the use of the
deaf, the church building or rooms in it are generally
given over at certain times. In a few
cases the deaf are in possession of edifices of their
own.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<h4>Newspapers of the Deaf</h4>

<p>With the deaf there have been a number of
special papers, published by and for them, and
circulating for the most part only among them.
Their chief purpose is to chronicle the various
happenings in deaf circles, and to serve as a
medium for the discussion of matters of general
interest to the deaf. These papers are usually
weeklies or monthlies, more often the former,
and frequently have correspondents in a greater
or smaller number of localities. There have been
not a few ventures in the establishment of such
independent papers, but most of them have
proved short-lived for want of sufficient support,
some being of very brief duration, and only an
exceptional one continuing over an extended
period. As a rule there have been seldom
more than two or three in existence at any
one time.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> In addition, there have been several
religious papers for the deaf, often under the
auspices of some denominational body, but
usually published by the deaf themselves. These,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
however, have never been numerous, and have
been of limited circulation.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

England Gallaudet Association of the Deaf, which began in
1853. It resulted largely from the Gallaudet Memorial Association,
organized two years before to raise funds for a
monument to Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. In 1859 was created
the Alumni Association of the High Class of the New York
Institution; in 1865 the Empire State Association; and in
1870 the Ohio Alumni Association. See Proceedings of National
Association of the Deaf, iv., 1893, p. 25.</p></div>

meetings, where conversation can be carried on freely
without attracting public notice. Some of these club rooms

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_130_130" id="Footnote_130_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_130_130"><span class="label">[130]</span></a> This spirit is illustrated in many ways, perhaps most
strikingly in the case where a deaf man seems likely to be
debarred from some public position because of his want of
hearing, when the deaf promptly rally to his support. We
have already seen their action in connection with the order of
the Civil Service Commission. Sometimes candidates for office
have been asked to state their views on this subject. As a
further instance of mutual assistance among the deaf may be
mentioned the raising of relief funds for deaf sufferers in
other localities in times of some great disaster.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_131_131" id="Footnote_131_131"></a><a href="#FNanchor_131_131"><span class="label">[131]</span></a> In Ohio and Pennsylvania the state societies manage homes
for the aged deaf, as we have seen; and in Virginia the state
association supports a special missionary to the deaf. In
Pennsylvania there are many county sections of the state
body. In a number of centers a leading association is that of
the alumni of Gallaudet College.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_132_132" id="Footnote_132_132"></a><a href="#FNanchor_132_132"><span class="label">[132]</span></a> There has also frequently been discussion of a federation
of the various state and local organizations. See Proceedings

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_133_133" id="Footnote_133_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_133_133"><span class="label">[133]</span></a> Such churches are now in New York, Philadelphia and
Wheeling, under Protestant Episcopal auspices; in Milwaukee
under Lutheran; and in Baltimore under Methodist. Special
church buildings are also in contemplation in other cities.
Funds for these churches are raised by the deaf with the assistance
of their hearing friends. In the Roman Catholic
Church there is a special organization of the deaf, founded in
1910, and known as the Knights of l'&Eacute;p&eacute;e.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_134_134" id="Footnote_134_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_134_134"><span class="label">[134]</span></a> There have been about thirty such publications created, the
first of which seems to have been begun in 1839, and the
second in 1860. See especially "Periodicals Devoted to the
Interests of the Deaf," by the Volta Bureau, 1913. See also

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>POPULAR CONCEPTIONS CONCERNING THE
DEAF</h3>


<h4>Viewed as a Strange Class</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> position of the deaf in society is yet to
be seen from another standpoint. The
question may be asked, How does the
public at large, how does "the man in the street,"
look upon the deaf? Are the deaf viewed
merely as so many people deprived of the sense
of hearing, in whom also the power of speech is
often wanting? Or is there superimposed upon
this a feeling, owing perhaps to the supposed
isolation of the deaf, that they are in other ways
a peculiar class of beings?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is the latter of these two
conceptions that is the prevailing one&mdash;unfortunately
for the deaf, for their burden is quite
sufficient as it is. The public has been and is
under many misapprehensions and delusions regarding
the deaf.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Being thrown intimately
with them but seldom, people often come to form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
curious ideas respecting the deaf, but ideas
which are more or less unhappy ones. There is
frequently an attitude towards them combined of
wonder, misgiving, fear, aversion&mdash;a vague feeling
or belief that the deaf are more or less distinct
in their thoughts and actions from other
people, that they are somehow "unnatural" or
"uncanny."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>


<h4>Viewed as a Defective Class</h4>

<p>Not only are the deaf often looked upon as
a strange class in the community, but they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
are not uncommonly known as "defectives," and
this is the classification frequently applied to
them. It is true that the deaf are "defective"
in that they are deprived of one of the most important
of the physical senses; but, in addition,
the term often carries a connotation of mental, or
even of moral, aberrance, and results in the infliction
upon the deaf of an unnecessary brand. In
many libraries such a classification is found, and
the deaf are catalogued under the heading "defective."
In the "Index of the Economic Material
in Documents of the States of the United
States" of the Carnegie Foundation, the deaf
and the blind are grouped as "defectives" along
with the feeble-minded and consumptives.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
Though in such a classification, any untoward
signification is disclaimed, and it is held to be
merely one of convenience of arrangement, it remains
true that terms are employed and associations
involved that to a certain extent do a very
real injury to the deaf.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<h4>Viewed as an Unhappy Class</h4>

<p>People are also prone to think of the deaf as an
unhappy, morose or dejected class. Professor
E. T. Devine in his "Misery and its Causes"
(1909)<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> enumerates the deaf, among other
classes, as embodiments of misery&mdash;"not for the
most part," he is careful to state, "personally
unhappy," but rather with reference to their imperfect
senses. This view is clear enough, and in
one sense is doubtless correct; but it does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
express the entire situation in respect to the deaf.
While their deafness must always be a serious
and distressing affliction, and even handicap and
burden as well, and while the deaf must often
bemoan their fate, it yet seems to be true that
the deaf as a lot are not "unhappy." They are
good-natured, see the world from an odd angle
sometimes, yet are as much philosophers as the
average man; and when in the company of their
deaf associates are able to derive fully as large a
portion of happiness as any other group of human
beings. The deaf are cheerful, swayed by the
same emotions as other mortals, responsive
equally to all the touches of life, and are not, at
least in these days of education, a morbid, brooding,
passionate folk, as is too often the popular
judgment.</p>


<h4>Viewed as a Dependent Class</h4>

<p>In some quarters the deaf continue to be looked
upon as one of the dependent classes of society.
Mr. Robert Hunter in his "Poverty" (1904)<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
under the head of "Dependents and their Treatment"
places the deaf and dumb as "absolute
dependents." Such views, however, are no
longer general, the deaf having themselves demonstrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to what extent they are a self-supporting
part of the community. But where this belief
is still shared, the deaf are thought in many
cases to be in need of aid or public charity; or at
any rate to be economically inferior to the rest
of society. Deaf pupils in the schools, for instance,
are often referred to as "inmates" or even
as "patients," not only by the public but by newspapers
as well; and the schools themselves are
often spoken of as "asylums" or as charitable institutions.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
This nomenclature is hardly defensible
on any ground, and by it the education
of the deaf is not even given its true status.</p>

<p>As a further illustration of the general feeling,
though rather of different order, may
perhaps be cited the attitude of the general insurance
companies toward the deaf. Though
some of the companies accept the deaf at their
regular rates, a number refuse them altogether,
while others limit their liability or demand an extra
premium.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> This is largely because of the fear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
that the deaf are more liable to accidents than
other people; but in point of fact the deaf seem
to be a long-lived people, and it is likely that with
greater statistical knowledge concerning them,
most of the discrimination would cease.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>


<h4>Need of a Changed Regard for the Deaf</h4>

<p>Thus in many ways are the deaf made to suffer
from popular misconceptions, and quite unnecessarily.
Too long have designations been
employed regarding them that call up undeserved
associations. Too long have they been set
down as a strange and uncertain body of human
beings, removed in their actions, manners and
modes of thought from the rest of society. The
interests of the deaf require a different consideration
and treatment. They demand that the deaf<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
be regarded exactly as other people, only unable
to hear. Theirs will be a great boon when they
are looked upon no more as a distinct and different
portion of the race, but entirely as normal
creatures, equally capable and human as all other
men.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_136_136" id="Footnote_136_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_136_136"><span class="label">[136]</span></a> Very often in the public mind the deaf and the blind are
associated, the two classes sometimes becoming more or less
merged the one into the other, and the problems of the one are
not infrequently assumed to be those of the other. As a matter
of fact, there is but one point of similarity in the two
classes&mdash;both are "defective" in that they are deprived of a
most important physical sense. The gulf that really separates
the blind from the deaf is far deeper than that which lies between
either of the two classes and the normal population.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_137_137" id="Footnote_137_137"></a><a href="#FNanchor_137_137"><span class="label">[137]</span></a> In this connection it may be interesting to note the regard
for the deaf as has been indicated by the deaf characters that
have been created in fiction. Though not a large number are
found, there is displayed towards them an attitude largely of
kindly sympathy, in some cases mingled with wonder. Such
characters appear in Lew Wallace's "Prince of India", where
three deaf-mutes are instructed to speak; Scott's <i>Fanella</i> in
"Peveril of the Peak"; Dickens' <i>Sophy</i> in "Dr. Marigold"
(an unusually attractive and lovable character); Collins'
<i>Madonna Mary</i> in "Hide and Seek"; Caine's <i>Naomi</i> in "The
Scapegoat"; Haggard's "She"; Maarten's "God's Fool"; de
Musset's "Pierre and Camille"; and elsewhere. Thomas Holcroft's
"Deaf and Dumb; or the Orphan Protected" is an
adaptation from the French play "Abb&eacute; de l'&Eacute;p&eacute;e" of J. N.
Bouilly, in 1802, in which the founder of the first school for
the deaf and his pupils are touchingly portrayed. Feigned
characters are also found, as Scott's mute in "The Talisman";
in Moliere's "Le M&eacute;decin malgr&eacute; Lui"; Jonson's "Epicoene";
and John Poole's "Deaf as a Post". Defoe has a character,
<i>Duncan Campbell</i>, which is possibly based on one from real
life, being referred to by Addison in the <i>Spectator</i> and the
<i>Tatler</i>. On the subject of the deaf in fiction, see <i>Silent
Worker</i>, Dec., 1893; <i>Annals</i>, xxxix., 1894, p. 79; Indiana
Bulletin of Charities and Corrections, June, 1897; <i>Athenaeum</i>,
Feb., April, 1896.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_138_138" id="Footnote_138_138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_138_138"><span class="label">[138]</span></a> It may be recorded here that in the present compilation of
the Bibliography of the United States Bureau of Education,
the expression formerly used, "Delinquents, Dependents and
Defectives", has been dropped in favor of the term, "Special
Classes of Persons". On this subject, see Proceedings of
National Educational Association, 1901, p. 876.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_139_139" id="Footnote_139_139"></a><a href="#FNanchor_139_139"><span class="label">[139]</span></a> A possibly more serious misapprehension respecting the
deaf arises from the impression often current among a large
number of people, and apparently encouraged not infrequently
in the proceedings of some scientific bodies, to the
effect that nearly all deaf-mutes are so either because of a similar
condition in their parents or because of the existence in
the parents of some physical disease, sometimes of an immoral
character. This is in a great part due to the increasing emphasis
upon eugenics, with the desire to weed out from the population
as many as possible of the "unfit" or "defective". In
consequence has been the belief that if there were proper regulation
of certain marriages, especially of the deaf and of
others suffering from particular maladies, "deaf-mutism",
which is looked upon as an excrescence upon society, would
in the course of a short time be stamped out. An illustration
of this conception is the following extract from the Handbook
of the Child Welfare Exhibit held in New York in 1911 (p.
38): "Mating of the Unfit. 'The Law'. Marriages of cousins,
insane or feeble-minded, alcoholic, syphilitic parents and
effects. The cost&mdash;7,369 blind infants, 89,287 deaf and dumb,
18,476 feeble-minded". See also Proceedings of National
Conference of Charities and Corrections, 1912, p. 277; Report
of Philadelphia Baby Saving Show, 1912, p. 37; <i>Annals</i>, lvii.,
1912, p. 284. As a matter of fact, as we have already seen,
the question of deafness is not one so much of eugenics as of
medical science, although eugenics may well be called in play
in respect to the marriages of persons under unfavorable conditions,
including to an extent the congenitally deaf and those
having deaf relatives. The total number of the deaf, however,
marrying under unfavorable conditions, is not large.
Every effort to remove or diminish deafness is entitled only
to the highest praise; but when it is made to appear that
deafness generally results from such causes as are often
ascribed, it is seen how wrongly the deaf, upon whom a great
affliction is already resting, may be made to suffer.</p></div>

in his "Dependents, Defectives and Delinquents" says

efficiency, owing to their infirmity, that they must be
cared for in adult life and old age".</p></div>

1904 schools for the deaf and the blind are included, because

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_143_143" id="Footnote_143_143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_143_143"><span class="label">[143]</span></a> It is claimed that 95 per cent of the general fraternal
organizations consider the deaf as "hazardous" or "undesirable".
Proceedings of National Association of the Deaf, ix.,
1910, p. 53. Accident insurance is usually refused by all.
When an extra rate is charged in life insurance, this is usually
one-half of one per cent. On the subject of insurance and the
mortality of the deaf, see <i>Annals</i>, xxxiii., 1888, p. 246; xlix.,
1904, p. 274; Proceedings of Convention of American Instructors,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_144_144" id="Footnote_144_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144_144"><span class="label">[144]</span></a> The foregoing illustrate some of the most striking misconceptions
regarding the deaf. On the other hand, no doubt the
deaf as well as the blind suffer from sentiment on the part of
the public, and from the sensational accounts which appear
from time to time in the newspapers and magazines concerning
what the deaf have been found able to accomplish. Many
things are referred to as "wonders", as though it were
strange that they could be done by people without hearing,
some of the achievements of the deaf being set down as most
remarkable. Such writings are usually in a kindly spirit, and
may often serve a useful purpose in making known the similarity
of the capabilities of the deaf and of the hearing; but
when they make the deaf appear as a peculiar and unlike part
of the race, their effect may be most misleading. The worst
result is that the public becomes ready and willing to believe
almost any thing about the deaf.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED IN
THE DEAF</h3>


<h4>General Societies Interested in the Deaf</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> have now considered the interest of
society in the deaf in its several relations,
together with the treatment that
has been extended to them. It remains to be noted
whether there have been any private undertakings
organized in behalf of the deaf or interested
in their welfare, and what has been done by such
bodies.</p>

<p>In America virtually the only organizations
composed of persons not deaf and formed for the
purpose of advancing the interests of the deaf
have been those more or less closely related to the
education of deaf children, and with their exception
practically no movements in respect to the
deaf may be said to have been undertaken.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>These organizations interested in the instruction
of the deaf are of two divisions: bodies
actively engaged in the work of this instruction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and bodies only indirectly concerned. The first
division includes, on the one hand, associations of
instructors of the deaf, and, on the other, societies
or corporations formed to promote and establish
schools, which have either passed out of existence,
their mission being fulfilled, on the taking over
of the school by the state, or have remained in
control of certain schools&mdash;to be considered when
we come to the general provisions for the education
of the deaf. In the second division are three
kinds of organizations: the Volta Bureau, an
organization in a class of its own; associations of
parents concerned mainly with the instruction of
their own children; and undertakings interested
in the extension of religious knowledge to the
deaf, usually in the form of church missions.</p>


<h4>The Volta Bureau</h4>

<p>The one organization in America of large compass
and concerned solely with the interests of
the deaf is the Volta Bureau, located in Washington.
This has resulted from the gift of Dr. Alexander
Graham Bell in 1880, who having received
50,000 francs from the French government in
recognition of his services in the field of invention,
decided to use the money to establish the bureau
for the "increase and diffusion of knowledge relating
to the deaf." The bureau now contains
much information regarding the deaf as a class,
as well as carefully compiled data regarding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
many individuals; and also publishes works on
the deaf, including the "Volta Review," a
monthly periodical. It is much interested in the
methods of instruction of the deaf, while another
important aim may be said to be the elimination
of deafness as far as possible, or the removal of
many of the effects of deafness. Dr. Bell's total
benefactions to this bureau, together with the Association
to Promote the Teaching of Speech to
the Deaf, to which it is now joined, have
amounted to more than a quarter of a million
dollars.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>


<h4>Parents' Associations for the Deaf</h4>

<p>Associations of parents have been organized
chiefly in relation to the education of their own
deaf children, though in some cases friends as
well as parents are included. They have often
been particularly concerned in the creation of
day schools for the deaf, but have also shown an
interest in other ways.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> These associations have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
been mostly confined to cities, and have been organized
in a dozen or so of them, as Boston,
Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee,
St. Paul, New York, Los Angeles, and San
Francisco.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> State associations have been rare,
being found in only two or three states, as Ohio,
Wisconsin and Nebraska.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>


<h4>Church Missions to the Deaf</h4>

<p>Practically all the religious denominations have
shown more or less concern in the spiritual welfare
of the deaf, so far as individuals have been
affected, and many churches have deaf members
on their rolls. Some of the church bodies have,
in addition, given more particular attention to
the deaf, and have instituted special activities to
embrace as many of them as possible. Such
movements have their greatest opportunities in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the cities, where it is easier to reach the deaf than
in the scattered districts of the country, though
some efforts have been made there too. On
the whole, however, only a small part of the religious
duty towards the deaf is found to have
been done; and it remains beyond question that
they have been neglected in this regard far too
much, and that there is indeed a field "white
unto the harvest" for the spiritual well-being of
the deaf. Perhaps also there is no sphere of religious
endeavor where the need of mutual understanding
and co-operation is so manifest as
with the deaf.</p>

<p>The denominations that have taken special
action usually maintain what are called "missions
to the deaf," and have clergymen, both deaf
and hearing, who give part or all of their time to
the work. In a few of the larger cities, as we
have seen, special churches for the deaf have been
organized, supported with the aid of the denominational
body, while in other cases the use of the
church building is allowed to the deaf at certain
times. Visits are also made from time to time
to smaller places when a number of deaf people
may be assembled together, and special meetings
are arranged for them.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In such missions, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the aims are largely spiritual, there are often in
addition operations of a material character, with
appropriate attention to individual cases of
need.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Among Protestant Churches, the Protestant
Episcopal may be considered the pioneer, and
it has taken up the work with considerable
zeal and effectiveness. In 1850 work was begun
in the East, and in 1871 formally organized. In
1873 it was extended to the Mid-west, and in 1875
to the North-west and South-west. In a number
of the dioceses the work is now given attention, in
some of the large cities, as New York, Philadelphia
and Chicago, its labor being notable.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The
Lutheran Church has been active particularly in
some of the states of the Middle West, as in the
synods of Missouri, Ohio, and others, and in a
few cities of the East. The Methodists have likewise
been engaged in certain sections of the country,
especially in the South and in the Mid-west.
The Baptists have also taken up work, especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
in the South and in New England. Together
with the Congregationalists, they started action
in the latter section in 1884, though most of the
work in New England is now done by a union
organization of several denominations, called the
"Evangelical Alliance." In other Protestant
bodies little has been attempted beyond local undertakings
in a few places. The work of the
Roman Catholic Church in respect to the deaf is
well organized in a number of centers, and many
of the Catholic deaf are carefully looked after.
With the Hebrews most of the attention has been
confined to certain large cities.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>


<h4>Organizations Interested in the Education of the
Deaf</h4>

<p>There are in America three large bodies interested
in the education of the deaf, and composed
for the most part of those directly connected with
the work of education. These are the Convention
of American Instructors of the Deaf, the
Conference of Superintendents and Principals,
and the American Association to Promote the
Teaching of Speech to the Deaf, all meeting, as
a usual thing, triennially in different years. Of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
these the oldest is the Convention of American
Instructors, which was organized in 1850.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> It
is a large and representative body, and has manifested
its interest from the beginning in the general
welfare of the deaf, as well as in the particular
demands of education. The Conference of
Superintendents and Principals, as its name implies,
is composed of the heads of schools, and
was organized in 1868.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The Association to
Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf was
incorporated as such in 1890, though it was not
the first body concerned in this work.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> It is now
countrywide, and embraces a large number of
those interested in the teaching of speech to the
deaf, whether active educators or not. A large
section of its members are "pure oralists," that
is, believing in the exclusive use of speech with
the deaf. In 1908 the Volta Bureau was taken
over by this body.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> It may be mentioned here
also that the educators of the deaf are represented
in the National Educational Association.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<h4>Publications Devoted to the Interests of the Deaf</h4>

<p>There are two publications devoted to the interests
of the deaf: the "American Annals of
the Deaf" and the "Volta Review," both published
in Washington. The former was begun in
1848. It appears bi-monthly, and is under the direction
of the Conference of Principals.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> It has
long been known as the standard periodical relating
to the deaf in America, and represents
current thought and opinion of practical educators
of the deaf, as well as constituting a general
record of the work. The "Volta Review," formerly
known as the "Association Review," was
begun in 1899, and was published by the Association
to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the
Deaf. It is now published conjointly by the Association
and the Volta Bureau, and appears as
an illustrated monthly. It is "devoted to the
problems of deafness," but deals in the greatest
measure with the matters pertaining to the education
of the deaf.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> In most of the residential<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
schools, or institutions, there are also papers,
which often serve to keep parents and others informed
of the work of the respective schools. We
have already referred to the publications by the
deaf themselves, both secular and religious.</p>

Review</i>, ii., 1900, p. 146. Most of the associations have also
been interested in the employment of the oral method of instruction.
Dues in such associations are usually only one or
two dollars, and there is often a board of directors appointed.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE EDUCATION OF THE DEAF PRIOR TO
ITS INTRODUCTION INTO THE UNITED
STATES</h3>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Among</span> the ancient peoples generally the
deaf and dumb, especially those so by birth,
were deemed as of deficient mentality, and
were accounted, intellectually, as little better than
children, or, indeed, as idiots. Though treated,
it seems, for the most part humanely, they were
regarded not without some aversion; and their
affliction was not infrequently looked upon as a
visitation of the gods, some of the hardy races
even destroying their deaf offspring. For a
long period there were scarcely any serious attempts
to give instruction to the deaf.</p>

<p>Allusions to the deaf and their state with respect
to education are found in certain of the
Greek and Latin writers, and occasionally in
those of other languages. Herodotus speaks of
the deaf son of Cr&#339;sus, and Hippocrates has
reference to the deaf as a class. Plato and Aristotle
also make mention of the deaf, the latter
considering them incapable of education because
of the absence of the sense of hearing. Among
Latin authors we find an account by Pliny the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Elder of a deaf man who had learned painting.</p>

<p>It is only after the fifteenth century that we
have more or less authenticated accounts of the
instruction of the deaf, and many of these are
hardly more than a passing reference here and
there. It was, moreover, well after Europe
had taken its present political appearance that
the modern attitude towards the deaf and their
instruction began. Before this their education
as a class was not thought of, and while no doubt
there have always been sporadic instances of the
instruction of the deaf, it is only since the middle
of the eighteenth century that the deaf have come
generally into the birthright of their education.</p>

<p>Yet it is not so great a matter of wonder that
the movements for the instruction of the deaf
took organized shape so late in the world's civilization.
Learning or schooling was in no sense
popular till some time after the passing away of
the so-called dark ages. For long it was rather
the privilege of the rich and powerful. The great
mass of the people were not deemed worthy of
learning, and education itself in any general application
did not have a recognized standing in
society. After the Renaissance, however, had
ushered in a new age, and when the desire for
learning was the master passion among many
men in Southern and Western Europe, it is natural
to suppose that efforts should have more frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
been made to instruct the deaf child; and
after this time we are prepared to find an increasing
number of instances of the instruction of the
deaf. This was all the more true when an air of
mystery was felt to surround these silent ones,
and to bring the light of the new learning to these
afflicted creatures was considered well worth the
attempt.</p>

<p>The earliest instance recorded of instruction
given to the deaf in the English language is that
of the Venerable Bede about the year 691, who
tells of a deaf person taught to speak by Bishop
John of York, related as though it were a miracle.
After many years we meet accounts of other
cases. Rudolph Agricola (1443-1485) of Gr&ouml;ningen,
Holland, and later a professor at Heidelberg,
cites in his "<i>De Inventione Dialecta</i>" a
deaf man who could write. In Italy a little later
we find certain deaf children whose instruction is
mentioned by Pietro de Castro; while in the sixteenth
century Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576),
the distinguished physician of Pavia, attempted
to state the principles of the education of the deaf,
demonstrating the use of a written language for
them, and advocating the teaching of speech. He
further invented a manual alphabet, which was
one of the first of its kind. In 1616 Giovanni
Bonifaccio also wrote regarding the "art of signing"
and speech for the deaf.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is to Spain that credit is to be given as
being the first country of Europe where there are
recorded accounts of successful instruction of the
deaf. In 1550, or perhaps earlier, Pedro Ponce
de Leon of the Order of St. Benedict taught,
chiefly by oral methods, several deaf children in
the convent of San Salvador de O&ntilde;a. Great
success must have attended his efforts, for in
addition to the Spanish language and arithmetic,
his pupils are reported to have mastered Latin,
Greek and astrology. About this time there
lived a deaf artist, known as <i>El Mudo</i>, and he
had very likely received instruction in some way.
In 1620 Juan Pablo Bonet, who had had
several deaf pupils, instructing them largely in
articulation methods, published a treatise on the
art of instructing the deaf, called "<i>Reduccion
de las Letras y Arta para Ense&ntilde;er a Hablar los
Mudos</i>;" and he was the inventor of a manual
alphabet, in considerable part like that used in
America to-day. Sir Kinelm Digby of England,
visiting Spain about this time, saw Bonet's work
and wrote an account of his pupils.</p>

<p>In 1644 appeared in England "<i>Chirologia</i>,
or the Natural Language of the Hand" by a
physician, Dr. John Bulwer, who had perhaps
also observed the results in Spain. This was
followed in 1648 by his more important work,
"<i>Philocophus</i>, or the Deaf and Dumb Man's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Friend," mostly describing a kind of process in
articulation and lip-reading. Bulwer's friend,
John Wallis, a professor at Oxford, seems to
have been the first practical teacher here, instructing
two deaf persons by writing and in
speech, and showing them to the King. In 1653
his "<i>Tractatus de Loquela</i>" was published.
Along the same line was the writing of Dr.
William Holder on the "Elements of Speech,"
published in 1669, in which he advocated articulation
teaching. In 1670 there appeared a treatise
by George Sibscota on "The Deaf and Dumb
Man's Discourse," but this was really a translation
from the writings of a German named Deusing.
In 1680 Dr. George Dalgarno of Scotland
published his "<i>Didascalocophus</i>, the Deaf and
Dumb Man's Tutor," in which preference was
given to the use of a written language and a
manual alphabet, of one of which he was himself
the inventor. In 1698 appeared "<i>Digiti
Lingua</i>," written "by a person who had conversed
no otherwise in above nine years." Some
half a century later we find the name of Henry
Baker, son-in-law of Daniel Defoe, who gave
instruction in speech.</p>

<p>Other countries of Europe were hardly behind
England in their interest in the deaf and
their instruction. Spain, besides the names we
have mentioned, had notably Ramirez de Carion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
himself a deaf man, who lived not long after
Bonet. Italy had in particular Padre Lana
Terzi, who in 1670 published a work on articulation;
and also Fabrizio d'Acquapendente and
Affinit&eacute;, who in their writings threw out references
to speech for the deaf. In Holland there
were Peter Montans, who about 1635 issued
several tracts on speech; Jan Baptista Van
Helmont, who in 1667 wrote on speech and an
alphabet; and John Conrad Amman, formerly
a Swiss physician, who in 1692 gave out his
"<i>Surdus Loquens</i>," which was enlarged and
republished in 1700 as "<i>Dissertatio de Loquela</i>."
The name of Amman is especially notable, not
only for his instruction in speech of several deaf
children, but for his influence on later oral
methods. In Switzerland we find at Basel in
1531, or perhaps a few years sooner, an account
of a deaf person who was instructed in speech by
&#338;colampadius, the Reformer and friend of
Luther; at Geneva in 1604 of a deaf child instructed
by St. Francis de Sales; and also in
Geneva in 1685 of a deaf person who had probably
received instruction.</p>

<p>In Germany we have a regular succession of
names of those who either attempted to instruct
the deaf or who wrote of this instruction, some
of these names being among the earliest of those
in Europe who showed an interest in the matter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
In the year 1578 we meet the name of Pasch, a
clergyman of Brandenburgh, who taught his
daughter by means of pictures. In 1621 Rudolph
Camerarius wrote a book on speech, and in 1642
Gaspard Schott mentions a case of successful
instruction. In 1701 or 1704 Kerger at Liegnitz
in Silesia taught some pupils orally, having what
seemed a temporary school. In 1718 Georges
Raphel, who had taught his three deaf daughters,
wrote a book explaining his process of instruction.
Among other names appearing earlier or
later were those of Morhoff, Mallenkrot, Wild,
Niederoff, Lichwitz, Shulze, Ettmuller, Arnoldi,
Lasius, Heinicke, and Nicolai. Of all these
much the most renowned is that of Samuel
Heinicke. In 1754 at Dresden he became interested
in the deaf, and a few years later started
a school near Hamburg. In 1778, at the instance
of the state, he moved to Leipsic, his school thus
being the first public school for the deaf to be
established. He was also the author of several
books on the education of the deaf. Heinicke
was instrumental in bringing the oral method
into favor, and in many respects, so far as its
present use is concerned, may be said to be its
father. He was in fact one of the greatest
teachers of the deaf, and the influence of his work
has been felt in no small measure in America.</p>

<p>In France, too, there were great names, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
they were late in appearing; P&egrave;re Vanin,
Rousset, Ernaud, de Fay, Pereire, Abb&eacute; de
l'&Eacute;p&eacute;e, Abb&eacute; Deschamps, and others.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Of these
Vanin, Pereire, Deschamps, and de l'&Eacute;p&eacute;e are
the most notable. Vanin about 1743 instructed
some children by means of pictures and a manual
alphabet. Rodriguez Pereire, a Portuguese Jew,
had several pupils at Bordeaux before the middle
of the eighteenth century, and though his methods
were kept secret for the most part, he appeared
to have met considerable success, in 1749 giving
an exhibition before the Academy of Sciences.
Abb&eacute; Deschamps in 1779 published at Orleans a
work on the instruction of the deaf, largely
favoring the oral method. It is to Charles
Michel abb&eacute; de l'&Eacute;p&eacute;e, however, that is given
the highest reverence of all the initial workers for
the deaf, being the founder of the first regular
school, and receiving nearly equal distinction for
his impression on early methods of instruction&mdash;this
being especially true in respect to America,
where his influence in the introduction of the sign
language has been greater than any other man's.
The abb&eacute; had become interested in two deaf
orphans in Paris, whom he attempted to teach,
and in 1755 established a school near the city,
conducting it at his own expense. This proved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
a success, and he decided to give his whole life
to the instruction of the deaf. He wrote several
works on their education, the chief one being
"<i>La Veritable Mani&egrave;re d'Instruire les Sourds
et Muets</i>," published in 1784. The achievements
of de l'&Eacute;p&eacute;e were soon far-famed, and the
people were taken with their novelty. Many
honors were offered him, and his work was
brought to the notice of the French Academy
and approved. In 1791 his school was adopted
by the state. The successor of abb&eacute; de l'&Eacute;p&eacute;e
was abb&eacute; Sicard, and the work continued to
flourish in France.</p>

<p>Not long after de l'&Eacute;p&eacute;e and Heinicke had
started their schools in France and Germany respectively,
Thomas Braidwood, in 1760, opened a
school in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1784 a
school was established in Rome, in 1788 in
Madrid, and in 1801 in Genoa. In the early
years of the nineteenth century other schools
were started over Western Europe. Thus by
the time that the work for the education of the
deaf was to enter America, in the establishment
of the first school in the second decade of the
century, there were already in Europe a number
of schools in existence.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>HISTORY OF EDUCATION OF THE DEAF IN
THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<h4>Early Attempts at Instruction</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> first instance of which we have record
in America of an attempt to teach the
deaf was in 1679<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> when a man named
Philip Nelson of Rowley, Massachusetts, tried to
instruct a deaf and dumb boy, Isaac Kilbourn by
name, in speech, though with what success we do
not know.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> These, however, were the witchcraft
days, and the work of Nelson seemed such an
extraordinary thing that the ministers of the
community are said to have made an investigation,
fearing that witches might be involved in
the affair. The next instance of which we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
mention occurred in Virginia a century later,
when John Harrower, a school-master of Fredericksburg,
had in his school from 1773 to 1776
a deaf boy named John Edge, reference to whose
instruction is made in his diary.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>The earliest effort for the establishment of a
school for the deaf in America of which we know
was made almost contemporaneously with the
opening of the nineteenth century, and at the
time that such schools were being created over
Europe. There lived at this time in Boston a
man named Francis Green, who had a deaf son.
This boy he sent to the school in Scotland which
Braidwood had started; while he himself became
much interested in the subject of the education
of the deaf. In 1783 he published in England a
work entitled "<i>Vox Oculis Subjecta</i>." In 1803
he had, with the help of some of the ministers,
a census made of the deaf in Massachusetts, when
75 were found, and it was estimated that there
were 500 in the United States. Green felt the
need of a school, and in several of the publications
of the time appeared his writings, in which
he urged the creation of one.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p>It was in 1810, however, and in the city of
New York that the real beginning of deaf-mute
education in the United States was marked.
This was when John Stanford, a minister, found
several deaf children in the city almshouse and
attempted to teach them. Though his efforts
continued but a short time, it was these from
which resulted the establishment a few years later
of a school in the city, the New York Institution.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>In Virginia shortly afterwards a second school
was started, which in itself is to be set down as an
important stage in the course of the early attempts
to create schools for the deaf in America.
In 1812 there came to the United States John
Braidwood, a member of the family which was
in control of the institution at Edinburgh, Scotland,
in the hope of establishing a school. He
began plans for one at Baltimore, but before it
had gotten under headway, he was called to
Virginia to undertake the instruction of the deaf
children of William Bolling, of Goochland
County. This private school continued, with
seemingly satisfactory results in the progress of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the pupils, for two and a half years. In 1815
it was moved to Cobbs, Chesterfield County,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> to
be open to the public. The school now promised
well, and there were already several pupils.
However, Braidwood was looking about for
other opportunities, and had been in touch with
several parties in regard to the employment of
his services.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> In 1816 he went to New York,
where he proposed to start a school, and collected
a few pupils, only to return to Virginia again
after a few months. In 1817 he began operations
anew, this time at a private classical school
at Manchester under John Kilpatrick, a minister.
In less than a year this too was abandoned by
Braidwood, who soon after met his death. Kilpatrick
attempted to continue the school only a
year or two longer, possibly even taking a few
pupils with him when he moved to Cumberland
County in 1819; and so was brought to an end
the checkered career of this early school for the
deaf in Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p><p>Such were the beginnings of the instruction
of the deaf in America. With the exception of
these undertakings, barely touching the surface
in the number of children reached, the only means
of education possible in the land was in sending
children to a school in Europe, which was done
in the case of a few wealthy parents. For the
great mass of the deaf, isolated and scattered
though they were at the time, there was no instruction
to be had.</p>

<p>But this period was now nearly passed. Attention
in more than one quarter was being directed
to the deaf and the possibilities of their education;
and in the breasts of not a few men a feeling
was astir that instruction was somehow to be
brought to them.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The seed was already sown,
and by the time the school in Virginia was broken
up, others were beginning to arise elsewhere.
When the work was finally to be taken up, it was
to be upon a solid foundation which should last
with the lastingness of education.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<h4>Beginning of the First Schools</h4>

<p>The seat of the first permanent school to be
established in the United States for the education
of the deaf was Hartford, Connecticut; and the
name of the one man with which the beginning
work will forever be coupled is that of Thomas
Hopkins Gallaudet. America, however, was not
to commence the work of itself: the spirit and
the method had to be brought from Europe.</p>

<p>Early in the nineteenth century there lived at
Hartford a young deaf girl, Alice Cogswell by
name, the daughter of a physician, and in her a
group of men had become interested. An investigation
of the number of the deaf had been
made in 1812 by a body of clergymen, when 84
were found, and it was estimated that there were
400 in New England, and 2,000 in the United
States; and the question of a school had been
considered.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> In 1815 the friends of Alice Cogswell
decided to organize a society for the purpose
of providing means to instruct some of these,
and to secure an instructor. To take up this
work, attention was directed to Gallaudet, then
a young theological student. He was fixed upon
as the man to go to Europe and acquaint himself
with the methods there employed. Gallaudet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
responded at once to the appeal made to him,
and proceeded to prepare himself forthwith.</p>

<p>The same year, 1815, saw Gallaudet start upon
his errand, his expenses being defrayed by
the society.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> He first visited England, but
finding there a monopoly composed of the Braidwood
and Watson families, he betook himself to
France. In this country he met with a warm
reception, and here he eagerly set upon his labors
of study and investigation at the school which
de l'&Eacute;p&eacute;e had established. He observed closely,
and then the following year turned his face towards
America, equipped for the great work
before him, and bringing with him one of the
deaf teachers from Paris named Laurent Clerc.</p>

<p>On Gallaudet's return the second part of the
undertaking for the creation of a school was to
be accomplished, namely, the securing of funds,
which required half a year more. For this purpose
Gallaudet and a few others set about
soliciting contributions. New York, Philadelphia,
Albany, New Haven, and other cities were
visited, and the interest in the new undertaking
was shown by the response made.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> By the time
the school was ready to open, over $12,000 had
been obtained, which was soon after more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
than doubled.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The contributions came from
various sources, including individuals, societies
and churches, and were from not a few states,
and even foreign countries. A charter was
granted the society in 1816 by the legislature of
Connecticut; and $5,000 was appropriated for
the school,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> which was probably the first appropriation
of public money for education not in
regular schools.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>On April 15, 1817, the new school threw open
its doors, and thus was established the first institution
for the instruction of the deaf&mdash;in fact,
the first for any of the so-called "defective
classes." Its success was assured from the start,
and there were many applicants, coming from different
parts of the country. The school had to
depend mainly upon private contributions, and
for its maintenance efforts had to be continued
to collect funds, pupils being taken for this purpose
to several cities for exhibition, especially
before church assemblies and the legislative
bodies of New England.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> It was not long in
appearing, however, that, as the school was really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to be national in scope, the United States government
might be appealed to for aid. Visits were
accordingly made to Washington in 1819, and
the interest of certain of the members of Congress
was secured. Among these was Henry
Clay, who showed a particular regard for the
new undertaking, and it was largely through his
influence that Congress was prevailed upon to
bestow upon the school 23,000 acres of the public
land, from which in time $300,000 was realized.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
It was the understanding, there being no census
of the deaf at this time, that any state or individual
might participate in the benefit of this
grant, and that the school was to be open on
equal terms to all.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>Though the school was regarded as national in
one sense, it was also felt to be particularly New
England's from the share that these states took
in its development. Very soon after it had commenced
operations a lively interest had been
manifested; and in 1825 a meeting was held at
Hartford of official representatives of all these
states except Rhode Island, to discuss the possibilities
of co-operation in its work.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Hardly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
indeed, had the school entered upon its labor
when, without solicitation, Massachusetts began
sending its deaf children to it. It was followed in
turn by the others, all the states of New England
thus coming to provide for their children
here as at a common school&mdash;a policy continued
with all for many years. By this arrangement
a certain amount from the state treasury was
allowed for each pupil. The action of Massachusetts
was taken in 1819, of New Hampshire
in 1821, of Vermont and Maine in 1825, of Connecticut
in 1828, and of Rhode Island in 1842.
Two other states, far removed from New England,
also by special legislative grants provided
for pupils in this school for a time. These were
Georgia and South Carolina, both beginning in
1834.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> In addition, there were private pupils
sent here from a number of states.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The school at Hartford was now in full operation,
with a nation-wide interest upon it.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
scarcely had it received its first pupil when other
schools began to be established, and indeed New
York and Pennsylvania are hardly to be considered
behind Connecticut at all, schools in these
states being in the course of formation when the
Hartford school was opened. From the concern
now apparent in many sections, it was soon
evident that the new work was to spread over the
land, and that the education of the deaf had
achieved for itself an established position.</p>

<p>In New York, as we have seen, the Rev. John
Stanford had found several deaf children in the
almshouse of the city, and, moved by their condition,
had sought to teach them. Interest was felt
by other men, and the agitation for a school was
furthered by letters from the American consul at
Bordeaux in 1816, one of which was written by a
French teacher and addressed to the "Philanthropists
of the United States." A census was
made of the deaf in the city,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> meetings were held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
in their behalf, a notable one taking place at
Tammany Hall, and private funds collected. In
1817 a charter was secured from the legislature,
and the following year the school was opened.
The city of New York displayed a warm interest
in it, making a special appropriation at its beginning,
and undertaking the support of a number
of pupils for a time, besides furnishing
quarters free of cost. In 1819 the state legislature,
after an exhibit of pupils, decided to assist,
making an appropriation for the benefit of the
school, and soon afterward allowing a certain
amount for each pupil. In 1821 New Jersey
began sending children to the school, action being
taken in this state by a unanimous vote.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania followed close upon Connecticut
and New York. A committee had been organized
in Philadelphia in 1816 to secure contributions
for a school, and meetings had been held, though
without immediate result. Late in the year
1819, or early in 1820, David Seixas, a Jew, finding
several poor deaf-mute children to whom he
gave shelter, made attempts to teach them. In
the latter year a society was formed by certain
citizens, after a meeting in the rooms of the
American Philosophical Society; and being
pleased with the work of Seixas, it decided to
adopt his school. The following year, after
an exhibit of pupils, the school was incorporated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
by the legislature, and granted a <i>per
capita</i> appropriation of $160, while contributions
from friends were numerous. In 1821, also,
pupils were admitted from New Jersey, this state
providing for them both at the New York and
Philadelphia schools. In 1827 Maryland, and in
1835 Delaware, authorized the sending of children
to the Pennsylvania Institution, exhibits of
pupils having been made before the legislatures
of these states.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Kentucky in 1823 was the fourth state in the
Union to establish a school. In this case, however,
action was taken directly by the legislature,
and the school has always been the property of
the state. In 1826<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Congress granted to it a
township of land in Florida, on the theory that
this school would be the center for pupils from
the western and southern states; and it was for
some years the place of education for many of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the children from the southern states,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and also
for a number from western states. With the
establishment of this school directly by the state
begins a new policy in the provision for the
education of the deaf&mdash;the work no longer being
entrusted to private individuals and societies.
All the states that followed Kentucky in the creation
of schools, with the exception of Maryland
and some of the New England states, adopted
this policy.</p>

<p>Ohio came next in 1829, although an attempt
had been made to establish a school in Cincinnati
as early as 1821.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Pupils were also received
into it from neighboring states.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> In 1838 Virginia
established a joint school for the deaf and
the blind, after exhibitions of pupils had been
given in the state. In Indiana a private school
was started in 1841, and three years later the
state institution, action being taken by the
legislature without a single dissenting vote. In
this state another stage is reached in the work of
educating the deaf: education which had hitherto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
been, by statute, free to the "indigent" only
is in positive terms made free to all. This was
done in 1848, and the action has been thus described:<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The doors of all asylums built at public expense for
mutes, for the blind, and for lunatics were thrown open
to all, that their blessings, like the rain and dew of
heaven, might freely descend on these children of misfortune
throughout the state, without money and without
price.</p></div>

<p>Well might this paean break forth, for this is
probably the broadest benevolent legislation ever
enacted up to this time.</p>

<p>In Georgia a private school was opened in
1842, and in 1846 the state school was established,
after a visit of pupils from the Hartford school.
In 1845 a school was started in Tennessee, after
an exhibit of pupils from Kentucky. The same
year in North Carolina, after an exhibit of pupils
from Virginia, a school was opened for the deaf
and the blind, though one had been projected as
early as 1828.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> In 1846 a school was established<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in Illinois, the bill passing the legislature by a
unanimous vote. To it came pupils from
Missouri, Iowa and Wisconsin. In 1849 a
school was established in South Carolina. Thus
by the middle of the nineteenth century, or
thirty-two years after the founding of the first
school in America, there were schools in a dozen
states. In the next quarter century schools were
created in nineteen other states, and since in
nearly all the remainder.</p>


<h4>Early Ideas concerning the Schools for the Deaf</h4>

<p>It was but natural that for some years the
providing of schools for the education of the
deaf should be looked upon with wonder. To
many the very thought of their instruction
seemed strange. Curious notions had been held
as to the deaf-mute's mind, and it was not certain
how far it was capable of instruction.</p>

<p>By some the idea of the education of the deaf
was received with scarcely concealed skepticism,
and despite the enthusiasm of the promoters and
despite the cordial interest manifested in many
quarters, there were not a few doubters. Efforts
to educate the deaf were even declared quixotic
and absurd. When the state of Illinois was
erecting a building to be used as a school, it was
by some called "the state's folly."<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
legislatures themselves occasionally had misgivings,
and now and then an appropriation was
voted for a school more in hope than otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
The work was thus with many often misunderstood,
and a few of the schools did not have altogether
easy sailing.</p>

<p>But when it was found that the deaf could be,
and were being, educated, not only were all
doubts dispelled, but the astonishment almost
goes beyond bounds, and even passes into a
rapture of thanksgiving. Visitors, in some
cases, flocked to the places where these wonderful
things were transpiring. They came to convince
themselves, and stood hushed in admiration
at the spectacle before them.</p>

<p>The accounts of a number of the early schools
attest the greeting given to the new work.
The New York Institution in its first report<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
speaks of the "numerous visitors" and their "expressions
of mingled surprise and delight." In
the new Pennsylvania Institution interest was
markedly aroused. By <i>Poulson's American
Daily Advocate</i> of Philadelphia it was stated
that 1,600 people crowded into a church to witness
an examination of pupils, and by the
<i>Columbian Observer</i> it was declared that this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
scene "was impressive beyond description," and
that "the exercises excited wonder mingled with
the acutest sensations of compassion for these
isolated beings."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> An early report of the
Tennessee School<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> speaks of the interest
"evinced by the great numbers of persons" who
visited the school, which was shown "by the
sympathy warmly expressed with the great
affliction" of the pupils, and the "surprise at
the attainments made by them."</p>

<p>Indeed, the new work is more than once referred
to in the accounts of the period as a
miracle. The age of miracles, we are told, was
not past.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> When a private school was opened in
Kansas, the advertisement ran: "Behold the
educational miracle of the nineteenth century.
The deaf hear, the dumb speak, the blind see."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
The wonders of education had become all the
more marked and expectations were aroused to a
high pitch, when it was seen about this time that
the blind and other classes as well were being
instructed. Great things were believed to be in
store for the human race.</p>

<p>With the schools for the deaf there was now
general approbation and support. Doubters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
were silenced, and the promoters took heart.
Soon the new institutions had won for themselves
a place in the intelligent and affectionate regard
of all; and to those instrumental in their creation
the people universally "pledged their gratitude."</p>


<h4>Aims of the Founders</h4>

<p>Though the first schools for the deaf in the
United States were founded to a considerable
extent with the idea of charity or benevolence
present, yet this was not so much the uppermost
purpose as to provide instruction for them; or
rather, it may be said that the benevolence itself
was prompted by the desire to see the deaf led
from the darkness of ignorance to the light of
education. It is true that many of the pupils
were recognized as entitled to material assistance
as well as instruction. Some of the schools
were chartered as benevolent institutions, while
several even avowed themselves as charitable
affairs.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> It is also true that the promoters
were in part concerned with deaf children found
in poverty, these being likely to engage not
a little attention. It was desired to furnish
homes for a number without charge; and early
accounts and statutes speak of the "care,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
"aid," "maintenance" or "support"<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> of these
children. But it is none the less true that the
great purpose in establishing institutions was
educational, and the instruction of the children
was the primary and chief thing guiding the
hands of the men who created the schools. In
the prospectuses of some of the schools any object
is disclaimed other than that of education.
In a circular describing the proposed school in
Kansas were the words: "This is not an asylum,
but a school for the education of the deaf."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
Homes, or institutions, were provided largely
for the reason that this plan appeared the only
practicable means of reaching a considerable
number of pupils.</p>

<p>With the early workers, then, the purpose was
to give the children an education. But this was
not all. In their vision, a far greater opening
presented itself. Heretofore the deaf had been
outcasts from society, had no place among
civilized beings, and were a dead weight in the
community. Now all was to be changed. Eyes
saw a glorious transformation: the deaf were to
be restored to society, and education was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
magic by which it was to be done. In full measure
were the founders thrilled with this prospect;
and to reclaim the deaf from their condition was
the great resolve.</p>

<p>Many of the early reports, charters and organic
acts express such a purpose, and speak of
the "lonely and cheerless condition" of the deaf,
and the hope to "restore them to the ranks of
their species." In the preamble of an "Address
to the Inhabitants of Pennsylvania," prepared
by the society to establish the school in this
state,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> the deaf are said to be in "entire and invincible
separation from the vast stores of knowledge
which human talent has accumulated&mdash;ignorant
of the truths of Revelation, her glorious
assurances and unspeakable consolations," all
being "among the bitter ingredients which fill
up the vast measure of the affliction to the deaf
and dumb;" and that "among the various
efforts of philanthropy and learning to enlarge
the circle of human happiness and knowledge,
none should perhaps rank higher than those
which have been directed to the discovery and
application of means for the instruction of the
deaf and dumb."</p>

<p>In language glowing and impassioned the condition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of the deaf without education is described.
Almost universally they are thought of as abiding
in impenetrable silence and deep darkness.
In an address delivered before the New York
Forum in behalf of the New York Institution<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
in its early days, it is asserted that the deaf dwell
in "silence, solitude and darkness," and in the
second report of this school<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> they are declared
to be "wrapt in impenetrable gloom of silence,
sorrow and despair." In an Ohio report<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> they
are said to be in "intellectual and moral midnight;"
and in a Michigan report<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> to be "groping
in thick darkness." In a Louisiana report<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
they are called "sorrow-stricken children of
silence;" and in a Kentucky report<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> their lives
are described as "dark, dreary and comfortless."
The <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i><a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> of Richmond,
Virginia, characterizes their existence as
"intellectual night." The New York <i>Commercial
Advertiser</i><a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> in the year the first school was
opened affirms that "their intellectual faculties
... are ... locked in the darkness of night and
shrouded in silence." In an address delivered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
shortly after the opening of the Tennessee
School<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> they are referred to as "entombed in a
prison." The <i>Albany Argus</i> and <i>Daily City
Gazette</i><a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> points to the deaf man as "abandoned
to his hard fate, to wander in darkness, the pitiable
object of dismal despair." In an address
delivered in the Capitol in Washington<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the deaf
are said to be "doomed to wear out their lives in
intellectual darkness."</p>

<p>The results of education were to be great beyond
measurement, and the passing of the deaf
from ignorance to education is likened even to
the glories of the Resurrection. A Committee of
Congress<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> in recommending the granting of
land to the Kentucky School speaks of education
as "the only means of redeeming this unfortunate
portion of our species from the ignorance and
stupidity to which they would otherwise be consigned
by the partial hand of nature, and, indeed;
of transferring them from a state of almost
mental blindness to that of intellectual and accountable
beings." The New York <i>Statesman</i><a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
speaks of the effects in "improving the moral
principle, which is torpid and almost obliterated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and opening the way to moral and religious
instruction and knowledge of the Deity which
is almost void." An early report of the
American School<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> tells of the transition
of their "imprisoned minds which have too long
been enveloped in the profoundest shade of intellectual
and moral darkness to the cleansing
and purifying light of Divine Truth." An Ohio
report<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> states that they "have come forth into
the light of truth, that truth that teaches them
that they possess a rational and immortal spirit."
In the address in behalf of the New York Institution
before noted,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> it is said of the deaf that
the "powers of torpid and dormant intellects
are resurrected from an eternal night of silence."
The first report of the Minnesota School<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> refers
to the deaf as "liberated from the winding sheets
of silence and ignorance," and tells how "their
souls vibrate with such joy as Lazarus felt when
he stepped forth from the gloom of the grave."</p>

<p>In the first report of the Indiana School<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
state of the deaf without education is thus contrasted
with that of the deaf with education:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Indeed, the difference between the uneducated and
the educated mute is almost incredible. The former
"winds his weary way" through life in ignorance and
obscurity, often an object of charity, and almost a
burden to himself; but the latter, gladdened by the
genial rays of knowledge and fitted for the discharge
of duty, becomes a blessing to his friends and to society,
acts well his part as a member of the great human
family, enjoys the present, and looks forward to the
future with cheerfulness and hope.</p></div>

<p>The charter of the Pennsylvania Institution
refers to the desire of certain citizens "to restore
the deaf and dumb to the ranks of their species;"
and the preamble of the statutes creating schools
in Kentucky and other states contains similar
language. The purpose of the Illinois school
is given in the organic act, the language of that
of Nebraska and other states being almost identical:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To promote by all proper and feasible means the
mental, moral and physical culture of that portion of
the community, who by the mysterious dispensations
of Providence, have been born, or by disease have become
deaf, and of course dumb, by a judicious and well
adapted course of education, to reclaim them from their
lonely and cheerless condition, to restore them to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
ranks of their species, and to fit them to discharge the
social and domestic duties of life.</p></div>

<p>The object of the schools in Wisconsin, South
Dakota, and other states is declared to be:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To afford the deaf and dumb of the state, so far as
possible, an enlightened and practical education, that
may aid them to obtain the means of instruction, discharge
the duties of citizenship, and secure all the
happiness they are capable of obtaining.</p></div>

<p>The early educators of the deaf felt themselves
that they were indeed carrying the light to shine
in a dark place. In the language of one of the
foremost of them:<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Then the great triumph of science and benevolence
over one of the most terrible of human calamities will
be complete, and the deaf and dumb, objects of interest,
but hardly of compassion, will stand forth among their
kindred who hear, heirs of all the hopes, the privileges
and the lofty aspirations of their race.</p></div>


<h4>Extension of the Means of Instruction over the
Country</h4>

<p>Interest in the education of the deaf had thus
become general, public concern was awakened,
and movements were early on foot in not a few
states to start schools. The enthusiasm aroused
by the success of the first schools only increased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the hopes that others would be provided to reach
the deaf children in all the states. A writer in
the <i>North American Review</i> in 1834<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> declared
that there were "no doubts that the wants of the
deaf and dumb will soon be supplied, and that
the public beneficence already extended to a portion
will, before the lapse of many years, be extended
to all."</p>

<p>Nor were these hopes to be shattered, for the
states followed each other in rapid succession in
providing means for the instruction of their deaf
youth. Indeed, when we consider how early
some of the newly settled states began to devote
attention to the education of the deaf&mdash;a work
that was undertaken in Europe only after the
middle of the eighteenth century&mdash;we are persuaded
that it speaks no less for the regard for
and devotion to education implanted in the
breasts of the American people, than for the bigness
and benevolence of their hearts. The credit
remains just as deep, even though it has ever
been the mission and spirit of America to bring
education to the door of every one of its children,
and though what it has done for the deaf is but a
part of this great principle.</p>

<p>The early workers, despite the preliminary
journeys to Europe, were largely pioneers, and
this country owes an immeasurable debt to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
founders and directors of the first schools. Many
of them were ministers of the Gospel, and all of
them were men of high ideals. Possibly there
has never been a movement undertaken for the
good of humanity that has drawn to it a more
capable or earnest band of men. These early
workers were possessed of a determination, an
ardor, a resourcefulness, combined with scholarship
and understanding of no common order, that
would have graced any human cause. They were
truly of those in America that have blazed trails,
and to them belonged those elements of character
that are a pride to any people.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>The first schools were created by societies of
private citizens, funds being contributed from
"membership fees" in the societies, from subscriptions
and from other private donations.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
To the aid of these schools the state later came
with appropriations; but while an oversight and
general control were assumed by it, the schools<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
were left as private corporations. With the establishment,
however, of the Kentucky School in
1823, a second stage is reached in the extension
of the new work, the state now undertaking the
task itself and providing the schools at its own
initiative and expense. At first admission into
the schools was restricted to a certain number of
pupils, often based upon some political division
of the state, as a senatorial district in Tennessee,
or a judicial in Ohio. When such limitations
were swept away, we have the third stage in the
provision for the education of the deaf. The
fourth and last stage&mdash;though not necessarily in
this order in any one particular state, and not in
every case formally accomplished&mdash;is attained
when in Indiana all charges are removed, and
education is made free to all.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> In the schools
created in later times all these steps were usually
merged into one: limitations of any kind were
mostly omitted, and the schools were in general
thrown open to all from the beginning.</p>

<p>Thus is reached the culminative point in the
course of the provision for the education of the
deaf in America. No longer was private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
benevolence to inaugurate and carry on the
work, but the state was coming to see its responsibility
in part, finally to realize its full duty in
making education free to all its deaf population,
just as it was free to the rest of its citizens.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>In many instances, before action by the state,
instruction of a small collection of deaf children
was taken up by a group of citizens;<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> but hardly
had this been done when as a rule the state proved
itself ready and willing to move in and shoulder
the responsibility. These private schools were
thus often the nuclei of the state institutions, at
first aided to an extent, and then taken over. In
fact, the private schools were not infrequently
started more or less as experimental affairs, but
with the expectation that the state would speedily
come to their help. "The idea of the founders
seemed to be to give barely enough to keep the
school going, and to depend upon getting support
of a substantial character in the course of time."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>In some cases there were exhibitions of pupils,
either from the school which was hoped to be
aided, or from an already established school in
another state. These were designed to awaken
interest in the public, and especially among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
legislators, and to quicken the desired action. In
more than one instance the school was established
at or near the state capital to show the legislatures
what could be done and to influence their proceedings.
Not infrequently memorials or petitions,
in some cases containing a great number
of names, were presented to the legislatures,
praying for the establishment of the schools.
Sometimes if doubt as to the wisdom of the proposed
course seemed to delay matters, a point
was to be gained in the dispatch as a preliminary
procedure of a special committee or agent to some
existing school in another state, to examine and
report upon its work, this report being, as was
expected, nearly always highly favorable.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>But appeals to these bodies, whatever their
nature, were rarely turned away, and usually
secured prompt response. When action was
finally to be obtained, the measure relating to the
deaf was passed with few dissenting votes, sometimes
with none at all. So eager had the representatives
of the people now become, that, if it
was not deemed practicable at once to create a
state institution, haste was made to provide for
the children in a school in another state till one
within their own borders could be established. In
some cases steps were taken to this end by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
legislative assemblies of territories before statehood
had been bestowed upon them.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p>At the same time not to be forgotten, in the
narration of the extension of the means of education
to the deaf of the country, is the real debt
to private action. It was private initiative that
often brought the schools into being, and it was
private solicitude that often won their final endorsement
and adoption by the state. In not a
few places there were citizens found who were
willing to give of their substance to forward the
new work.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> For some of the schools money was
not only subscribed, but it came also from the
proceeds of fairs and concerts, and for a few also
from lectures, debates, exhibits of pictures, and
similar affairs; while exhibitions of the pupils
themselves from the schools seldom failed to draw
a generous offering.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Indeed, many were glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of the opportunity to lend a hand, and contributions
were tendered not only by various individuals,
but also by different societies and organizations<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>&mdash;churches
probably among the latter
proving the most ready givers, with aid, in addition,
at time from newspapers, and now and then
from a school or college. In some cases funds
were collected by citizens with which to purchase
a site, and sometimes the land required was given
by the cities themselves. Indirect aid was extended
as well of not a few kinds; and in the
early schools there was seldom great difficulty
in securing reduced transportation on railroads
and steamboats.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>However, except in a few instances, private
assistance in the aggregate did not prove great:
as a rule in most schools it was limited, usually
sufficing only to tide them over their nascent
stage, and in large part ceasing upon their full
establishment. From then on the maintenance
was assumed practically entirely as a public
charge, the legislatures of the several states undertaking
themselves to provide for the schools.
In a few cases, however, there was public aid of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
another sort. In several schools there were allowances
for a longer or shorter period from municipal
funds, as in Maryland, Pennsylvania and
New York, and from county, as in North Carolina
and Utah.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> But much the most important
assistance of this character came from the national
government; and while only a few schools were
favored by its action, the benefactions to those
were hardly less than munificent. For the benefit
of the Connecticut and Kentucky schools
early in their careers Congress granted great
areas of the public domain; and later, on the admission
of half a dozen or so states in the West
into the Union, set apart extensive tracts for the
schools to be established in them.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>When the school for the deaf had been formally
recognized by the state, its first act of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
assistance as a rule was in the form of <i>per capita</i>
allowances for the pupils, with only occasionally
a specific appropriation. These allowances were
in the beginning small, but in time were gradually
increased. It was usually some years before the
policy was adopted of making regular appropriations.
In a few cases, as in Indiana and
Illinois, when it was decided to create a state
institution, the first proceedings were, in lieu of a
direct appropriation, the levying of a small mill
tax upon the assessed property of the state. In
New York benefit was allowed from the fines or
licenses on lotteries, and in Ohio from the receipts
of a tax on auctions in one of the counties of the
state. In a few cases the schools were even
located where there appeared the greatest financial
inducement,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> as with the requirement that a
certain number of acres of land should be donated
for the school.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>For the organization of the new schools a
small body of citizens was appointed, often the
original promoters of the undertaking, to act as
trustees, and to them was confided its direction,
with the support and general oversight of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
state back of them.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Now and then the trustees
of an existing educational or other institution
were given charge as a temporary arrangement.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>In the material projection of the schools, little
was to be expected at the beginning. With
the meagre resources at their disposal, the directors
had small choice in what was to be provided.
In not a few cases the schools started
out under conditions far from auspicious, and
in some the circumstances in connection with
their origin were quite discouraging.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The
quarters secured for the schools were nearly always
of unpretentious, and sometimes of humble,
type. Many began in a single rented room,
and a few in a church building lent for the purpose.
It was only in the course of the years, as
the communities grew in population and wealth,
that the establishments for the deaf assumed
appearances in keeping with their character.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>The schools for the deaf were now in being,
and were ready for the reception of their pupils.
But what of these pupils, and where were they?
Were they found at the doors of the new institutions,
clamoring for admission? The situation
was hardly this. In point of fact, in nearly every
case the schools were ahead of the pupils.
Though in practically every community where a
school was created, there were a greater or less
number of children in need of an education, these
children, or rather their parents, were slow in
availing themselves of the privilege. It was thus
that the schools when established had to wait, as
it were, for the coming of their pupils, and indeed,
in not a few instances, to go out after them.</p>

<p>On the opening of the schools, none was found
to have a large number of pupils, and in most
there were only a handful, as three, four or five.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
It was discovered that it was a far from easy
task to get the children in.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> The parents were
in no small measure ignorant themselves, and the
real value of the school was not always readily
understood. Besides, in many sections the country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
was new, the roads bad, and the facilities for
travel scant.</p>

<p>Oftentimes in the course of the founding of the
schools, before any direct act was attempted, a
census was taken of the deaf of the state. It was
also frequently made the duty of certain local
officers as county clerks, assessors, etc., to register
and report prospective pupils. By many
of the schools circulars were distributed to postmasters,
tax-collectors, ministers, school-teachers
and others to enlist their help in reaching deaf
children;<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> and by certain of the schools the newspapers
were even availed of to carry their advertisements.
Sometimes special agents were sent
out to scour the state and gather in pupils.</p>

<p>In many of the schools at the same time the
terms of admission were carefully prescribed,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
and in some, especially the older ones, these terms
were often published. Notices of vacancies were
also in a few cases put in the newspapers, while
in one or two instances, as in Massachusetts, it
was provided that lots should be drawn when it
was found that the number of applicants exceeded
the number allowed. In a large portion
of the schools at first the pupils were individually
committed, or were "appointed," as it was
called.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> It was usually some years before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
greater part of such formalities ceased. Charges
were also occasionally made at the beginning,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
later to be reduced and in time to be abolished.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>In most of the schools in their first days the
period of attendance allowed to the pupils was
very short, often being three or four years, and
sometimes only two. Usually, however, after a
time one or two years were added to the number
permitted, which procedure was repeated after
certain intervals, and the length of residence was
thus gradually increased. In few of the schools,
moreover, was an early age held essential; and,
indeed, in a considerable number pupils were not
admitted at an early age, the limit not infrequently
being ten or twelve.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The upper
limit was high as well, and in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
cases pupils might enter up to thirty. These
age limitations were also in turn lowered
in the course of time. Thus eventually we find
the ages of attendance as well as the general
rules and regulations of admission conforming
more and more to those of the regular schools.</p>

<p>The various schools that have been created for
the deaf have been for the most part boarding
institutions, in which the pupils have lived during
the school year. But beginning in 1869, and increasing
rapidly since 1890, a system of day
schools has been brought into being, more on the
order of the regular common schools, and more
distinctly an integral part of the state's educational
economy. Such schools, now over three
score in number, have been established in fourteen
states, and belong especially to large cities. They
may be regarded in many respects as denoting a
new departure in the educational treatment of
the deaf, and as marking the latest development
in the course of the instruction of the deaf in the
country.</p>

<p>In addition, there have been created a class
of schools, numbering some score at present,
which are of denominational or private character,
and are not affected by state control. Finally,
there has been established by the United States<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
government a national college for the deaf of all
the country&mdash;which may be called the crowning
feature in the provision for the education of
the deaf in America.</p>

<p>For the great number of the deaf&mdash;over five-sixths
of the total&mdash;the institutional schools remain
the one means of instruction. They have
been created in all but a few of the states, and in
those without them the children are sent to a
school in a neighboring state. In some of the
more populous states two or more schools have
been established. These schools are as a rule
supported entirely from the public treasury, and
are controlled by the legislatures, the actual administration
being delegated to boards of trustees
or other bodies. In half the states a regard
of an enduring kind has been manifested for the
schools in that provision for them has been included
in the constitutions, and these states are
thus committed to their maintenance.</p>

<p>In the schools themselves not only is education
presented in the usual sense, but in practically
all industrial training has also been provided to
no mean extent, and constitutes a prominent
feature of the work.</p>

<p>We have now traced the origin and development
of the schools for the deaf in the United
States. The present organization and arrangements
are to be considered in the following chapters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
We have found that the duty of the
education of the deaf has been recognized in all
the states of the Union; that to-day everywhere in
America provision has been made for the instruction
of the deaf; and that to all the deaf children
of the land the doors of education are open
wide.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

person who had received instruction, though hardly in America.
This was a woman who was blind as well as deaf, and
who lived at Ipswich, Massachusetts, in 1637. She had come
from England; but whether or not she had been taught before
the coming on of her affliction, we are left in ignorance.
All that we are sure of is that communication could be had
with her. See John Winthrop, "History of New England", ed.
1853, i., p. 281; <i>Annals</i>, xlv., 1900, p. 91.</p></div>

Carolina. A census of the deaf children in the state was made,
29 being found. The school here, however, was not started till
some years later. See Report of South Carolina School, 1904,
p. 7. In neither the case of this state nor that of Georgia
was the number of pupils annually sent to Hartford large,
ranging from 2 to 8 in each. See Report of American School,

as it was then called, till 1828, when he resigned. He was
engaged thereafter in various philanthropic activities, and was
invited to lead in the work for the education of the blind,
towards which attention was now being directed. Notwithstanding
the impairment of his health, his different labors
were continued, not the least of which was his office as chaplain
of the Connecticut Asylum for the Insane. To Thomas Hopkins
Gallaudet America owes a rare debt. Without him the
work for the deaf would have been taken up eventually by
other hands, but he brought to his task a disregard for obstacles,
a splendid idealism, a fine conception of duty, a complete
forgetfulness of self, a singular beauty of character, and a
great human love that could have existed in but few other
men.</p></div>

of the Deaf and Dumb". An association was formed,
and the legislature was asked to incorporate the school. In
1822 a census was taken for all the state except two counties,
when 428 deaf persons were found. The school was not established
on the ground that it was too far removed from the
center of the state. See <i>Annals</i>, v., 1853, p. 221; xxv., 1880,

the state of Ohio. In 1844, or four years before the action of
Indiana, the laws prohibiting the trustees from receiving more
than a certain number of indigent pupils in one year at the
expense of the state were repealed, and the trustees were
authorized to admit suitable pupils, as they might deem necessary
and proper. This probably had the effect of allowing all
pupils free attendance, though it remained with the trustees
to decide. The formal removal of limitations respecting indigent
pupils did not take place till 1854.</p></div>

societies, these dues were usually fixed at $5, with life membership
at $50, though the size of the fees varied in the different
schools. In the American School the office of vice-president
was created for those paying $200. In some of these schools
the fees proved of considerable assistance.</p></div>

the Ohio School. In 1829, at the beginning, an indigent pupil
was to be admitted from each of the nine judicial districts of
the state, "to be selected by the board of trustees from persons
recommended by the associate judges of the counties where
they reside". In 1830 the number was increased to eighteen,
in 1832 to twenty-seven, in 1834 to forty-eight, and in 1835 to
sixty. In 1844 all suitable applicants were to be received,
and in 1854 all limitations as to financial ability were removed.</p></div>

look with favor upon the rapid increase in the number of the
schools. The creation of many new ones was sometimes
advised against, it being declared that the existing ones could
answer for all the country, and that pupils would gain by
attending them. See Report of Pennsylvania Institution, 1830,

of schools. In 1826 Congress was asked for the endowment
of the institutions then in being which had not already been
assisted. See Address of Lewis Weld in the Capitol in Washington,
1828, p. 8. In 1833 the Senate passed bills granting
land to the schools in New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio,
but these failed to be acted upon in the House. Proceedings
of Laying of Corner Stone of Ohio Institution, 1864; Report
of Ohio School, 1869, p. 52. Later there were applications
from individual schools, most seeking grants of land. Requests
came from Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
North Carolina, Georgia, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, and
Nebraska. A township was usually desired, though Vermont
asked for 10,000 acres for the benefit of a hospital for the
insane and for the education of the deaf and blind. See

In Bloomington $4,000 was raised, and an offer extended of

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>ORGANIZATION OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND
GENERAL PROVISIONS</h3>


<h4>Arrangements in the Different States</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Provision</span> for the education of the deaf
is made by the different states as a general
rule in local institutions. In only four
states are deaf children sent at public expense to a
school outside for their instruction: Delaware,
New Hampshire, Nevada, and Wyoming.
In these, owing to their comparatively small populations,
it has been considered more economical
and satisfactory to contract with the school in
an adjoining state.</p>

<p>In each of the other states there is at least one
institution, or sixty-five in all. In Connecticut
and the District of Columbia<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> there are two,
in Massachusetts three, in Pennsylvania four,
and in New York eight. In some of these
the schools are distributed over the state the better
to reach all the pupils. In the Southern states
there are usually separate departments in the
regular institutions for children of the colored<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
race,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> but in some there are special arrangements.
In Virginia there is one school for the
white deaf and blind, and another for the colored.
In North Carolina there is a school for the white
deaf, and another for the blind with a department
for the colored deaf and blind. In Alabama,
Maryland, Oklahoma, and Texas each
there is a school for the white deaf and another
for the colored deaf and blind.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>In nearly all the states these schools are strictly
public institutions, owned by the state and supported
wholly by taxation, and are under the
direct control and supervision of the legislature.
In a few of the Eastern states the institutions
are in private hands and operated under their
immediate direction, and in some cases supported
in part by endowment funds, but at the same
time receiving appropriations from the state, and
subject to its authority and general oversight.
They are thus "semi-public" or "quasi-public"
institutions, and will need a brief separate treatment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
as will also the "dual schools," where the
deaf and blind are educated together.</p>


<h4>Semi-Public Institutions</h4>

<p>The semi-public institutions are seventeen in
number, and are found in six states: Connecticut,
Maryland,<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Massachusetts, New York,
Pennsylvania,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> and Vermont. Institutions in
these states have remained private corporations
from the time they were established, some of them
being, as we have seen, the first schools that were
created for the deaf. A certain number were especially
favored by private munificence at their
beginning, and continued to be supported by
private funds till the state came to their aid and
undertook to assist by regular appropriations.
Other schools have been similarly organized, but
have always depended largely on the appropriations
from the state. All of them are in the
hands of societies,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> organized and chartered as
corporations under the laws of the state. In some
cases membership is open to those interested
on the payment of the regular dues or fees.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p><p>These institutions, while corporate bodies, are
under the authority and supervision of the state.
Their relation to the state and the conditions
under which they exist may be understood from
their position in New York. Here the institutions
were chartered by the state as benevolent
societies, the buildings and grounds being presented,
or the money for them collected, by the
trustees, and the property reverting to the state
if alienated to another use.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> These schools are
all subsidized from the state treasury in <i>per
capita</i> allowances for the pupils received;<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> and
to some, especially the newer ones, there are
general appropriations from time to time for
buildings and the like. The regular grants, however,
are often not sufficient for the cost of maintenance,
which means that the institutions are instructing
the children of the state, and maintaining
them, at a cost to which the state contributes
only a part. Such balances are covered from the
endowment funds and private donations, but it
would seem that the state gets a good bargain
from the transaction.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p><p>On the other hand, it is to be remembered in
connection with these schools that in the matter
of the education of certain of the children of the
state this duty is turned over to a private society.
An anomalous situation, it would seem, is thus
created, the state abdicating one of its most important
functions as now conceived. The question,
however, is not of great practical moment,
and the matter may be likened to the general
policy of the state when it contracts out for any
of its work to be done. If economy and efficiency
are secured, it is felt that there can be little
ground for objection. A more important question
arises in the matter of the granting of public
money to a private institution. The matter of
such state subsidies has already received considerable
discussion,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> and may receive even more
attention in the future. Notwithstanding, these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
private institutions for the deaf were largely
organized before the present attitude in the matter:
they have in some cases really anticipated
the duty of the state, and in a general consideration
of the subject would probably be the last to
be condemned.</p>


<h4>"Dual Schools"</h4>

<p>"Dual schools," that is, schools in which there
are departments both for the deaf and the blind,
are found in ten states: California, Colorado,
Florida, Idaho, Montana, South Carolina, Utah,
Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> In a
number of other states the deaf and the blind
were for a certain period educated together,
either the two classes being provided for jointly
from the first or a department for the blind being
later created; but in time in these the two classes
have been separated, and distinct schools for the
blind set up.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>As a general thing, this arrangement of having
the deaf and the blind together in one school has
been regarded as unfortunate, and educators of
both classes have protested against it. The question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
has thus been stated: The deaf and the blind
"have nothing in common in the matter of education,
and the bringing of the two classes together
is a prolific source of friction and compromise."<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
The blind, it seems, are the worst sufferers, as
they are in a minority, are often considered only
a department or class in an institution designed
primarily for the deaf, and consequently receive
less attention than they should.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> However, this
arrangement has not been adopted as a deliberate
policy on the part of the state: rather, it was begun
when the school was young, pupils of both
classes few, and one plant was thought adequate;
and was allowed to continue as a makeshift till
separate schools could be created. As the states
have grown in population and resources, most
have seen the wisdom of severing the blind from
the deaf; and even in the states where the dual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
school is retained it is probably only a question
of time till provision will be made for the separate
education of the two classes, and eventually there
will be independent schools for each in all the
states.</p>


<h4>Provision for the Deaf-Blind</h4>

<p>In 1824 at the school for the deaf at Hartford,
Connecticut, the first deaf-blind pupil in
America began to receive instruction. To-day
the names of certain illustrious deaf-blind persons
are known over the civilized world.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Such children
are provided for at present more often in
schools for the deaf than in schools for the blind,
only one or two schools for the latter class instructing
them. The deaf-blind, however, do not
form a large class, and only in a small number of
schools are they to be found.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> In certain cases
where the school is only for the deaf, special permission
with a special appropriation has to be
obtained, but there has been little difficulty met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
here from the legislatures. To certain of the deaf-blind
individual benefactions have been made, as
legacies, donations and subscriptions, sometimes
given to the institutions to hold in trust; and in
some cases these funds are for life.</p>


<h4>Provision for the Feeble-minded Deaf</h4>

<p>In many of the schools for the deaf a problem
has arisen in connection with a number of feeble-minded
children more or less defective in speech
or hearing who have sought to gain admittance.
Educators of the deaf have been called upon to
give considerable attention to this class, and it
has been a serious question what to do with
them.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Many of those who have applied at the
institutions have been denied. Some have been
allowed to enter, and their presence in the schools
has constituted a difficult problem.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> It is felt by
those concerned in the education of the deaf that
they are out of place here, and that they should
be removed to a regular institution for the feeble-minded,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
or should otherwise be specially provided
for.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>


<h4>Government of the Different Institutions</h4>

<p>The government of schools for the deaf is practically
the same in the different states. They
are, for the most part, in the hands of boards of
trustees, boards of directors, boards of managers,
or boards of visitors, as they are variously termed.
The semi-public institutions, as we have seen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
were started as private concerns under private
boards of directors. These boards still exist, and
control the affairs of the institutions, having full
powers but subject to such regulation as the
state may direct. Such boards are usually self-perpetuating
bodies, though in some cases the
governor has been allowed to name a part. In
the American School the governors and secretaries
of state of the New England states are <i>ex-officio</i>
directors. In the case of some schools, as
the Pennsylvania Institution, where membership
is open to any one on the payment of the dues,
the governing board is elected by the members
of the society or corporation.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> In all these
boards the members serve without compensation.
Their size varies considerably, but they are
usually large, having in some cases over twenty
members.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>Where the school is strictly a state institution,
the board is usually appointed by the governor,
sometimes with the approval of the state senate.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
In a few cases the boards are elected by the legislature,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
as in Georgia and Tennessee. In Montana
appointment is made by the state board of
education. In several of the states the governor
or some other public officer, most often the superintendent
of public instruction, is a member <i>ex-officio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
These boards also as a rule serve without
compensation, and are paid only for expenses
actually incurred.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Their size is smaller than
that of the corporate boards, usually consisting
of from three to seven members, though in a few
cases they may go beyond the latter figure. They
are appointed to serve two, three, four or five
years, and in a few cases even longer. In states
where the members are elected by the legislature,
the term is usually indefinite; and in one or two
states, as in Alabama, the board is self-perpetuating.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>In eight states the institutions are under special
boards of their own, without supervision or regulation
from other bodies: Alabama, District of
Columbia, Georgia, Mississippi, New Mexico,
South Carolina, Texas, and Utah. In eighteen
states the schools are under special boards of trustees,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
while the state board of charities&mdash;or whatever
the official title&mdash;may visit, inspect, supervise,
advise, or may otherwise be connected with
them: California, Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana,
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Montana, New York, North
Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Virginia, and West Virginia. It may be noted
that such central boards&mdash;including the state
boards of control&mdash;are found in thirty-nine states,
and in all but five have some connection with the
schools.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In eleven states the schools are directly
under the state boards of control, central boards
or bodies with similar powers, no special or local
board intervening: Arkansas, Florida, Illinois,
Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon,
South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p><p>In some of the states, on the other hand, the
schools are related to the state department of
education. In four states they are under boards
of trustees, with supervision only by this department:
Colorado, Kentucky, Massachusetts, and
Rhode Island. In Idaho and New Jersey the
schools are directly under the department,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
though in the former there is also connection with
another state board. In Montana the board of
trustees is appointed by the department. In Indiana
and Oklahoma the schools have boards of
trustees and are under the department of education,
but with inspection also by the department
of charities. In New York and North Carolina
there is supervision both by the department of
education and of charities. In several states
the board of trustees includes the state superintendent
of public instruction as a member <i>ex-officio</i>,
as in Alabama, Louisiana, Minnesota,
South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. In
Kansas the school is under the state board of
administration for educational institutions, including
the university, normal school and agricultural
college, and in Florida the school is under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the board of control of state educational institutions,
while in Arizona the school is a department
of the state university.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>


<h4>Procedure in States without Institutions</h4>

<p>In states where pupils are sent to schools outside
the state, appointments and commitments
are usually made in the East by the respective
governors, and in the West by the boards of
education or of charities. In Delaware the governor
appoints pupils to outside schools, the state
supreme court having first recommended. In
New Hampshire the governor recommends, while
the children are placed by the board of control.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
In Wyoming the education of deaf children
is directed by the board of charities and
reforms, and in Nevada by the state department
of education.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

In regard to the value of the schools for the colored, the opinion
of the heads of the schools in the Southern states has
been ascertained by the Board of Charities of Louisiana. The
wisdom of the policy was agreed in by all, and the schools
were reported as doing well, as were their graduates. By one
superintendent it was stated that "ignorance is costly to the
state in more ways than one". Report, 1907, p. 43.</p></div>

plan. At one of the first conventions of the American Instructors
of the Blind, the following propositions were enunciated:
1. Deaf-mutes and the blind differ from each other more widely
than either class differs from those having all the senses;
2. the methods of instruction peculiar to each are entirely unlike
and incompatible; 3. the deaf engross the main attention;
4. the development of the blind department is retarded. Proceedings,
1871, p. 87. Educators of the deaf have likewise
stated their objections. At an early conference of principals,
a resolution was adopted that the arrangement was bad, the
methods being entirely different. Proceedings, ii., 1872, pp. 146,
151. See also Report of Michigan School, 1855 (first report),
p. 1; 1880, p. 62; Louisiana School, 1870, p. 30. In times past,
however, advantages of this arrangement have been pointed
out. See Report of California Institution, 1869, p. 15; 1873,

It has also been estimated that five per cent of the deaf are
feeble-minded. Proceedings of Conference of Charities and
Corrections, 1906, p. 254ff. On the subject of the feeble-minded
deaf in institutions, Mr. Cyrus E. White, of the Kansas School,
sent letters to the heads of 55 schools, receiving replies from
45. No state, it was found, had made special provision for the
feeble-minded deaf. It was the general agreement that they
should be in institutions for the feeble-minded, one superintendent
declaring that "feeble-mindedness is a better classification
than deafness". Another superintendent suggested
the establishment of such an institution in a central state, to
which the different states could send suitable cases. See
<i>Annals</i>, lv., 1910, p. 133. A committee of the Pennsylvania
Society for the Advancement of the Deaf has found that
all of the three feeble-minded institutions in this state are
crowded, and that there is no hope for the feeble-minded
deaf in them. Proceedings, xxiv., 1910, p. 9. In one institution
for the feeble-minded there are said to be twenty deaf
feeble-minded. <i>Annals</i>, liv., 1909, p. 444. In the institution for
the feeble-minded in Iowa a special class of such inmates was
organized in 1912. <i>Ibid.</i>, lviii., 1913, p. 107. It is to be remembered
in this connection that in many states there are
no institutions for the feeble-minded. Educators of the deaf
have often been instrumental in securing the creation of such
institutions. See Proceedings of Convention of American Instructors,
iv., 1857, p. 227. In a few states, as Illinois, Minnesota
and Washington, departments for the feeble-minded
have been created in schools for the deaf, the feeble-minded
being removed later. In Montana a department is still maintained.</p></div>

Maine, Minnesota, Montana, and West Virginia, the boards
of charities or central boards have only more or less financial
concern, the statutes usually referring to some such connection
with the several state institutions, though not always
mentioning them by name. In one or two states, as Rhode
Island, there is connection with a board of purchases and
supplies. In Minnesota there is also a board of visitors for
state institutions, exerting rather a moral supervision.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_280_280" id="Footnote_280_280"></a><a href="#FNanchor_280_280"><span class="label">[280]</span></a> The duties of such boards may be indicated from the following
extract in a letter to the writer from the Secretary of
the Wisconsin Board: The board "appoints the chief officers,
purchases all the supplies for the institutions, formulates the
provisions under which the institutions are managed, and has
almost unlimited power with reference to the institutions".
The boards thus have practically complete control of the
public institutions of the state, and in some cases state universities
have come within their direction. The boards have
come especially into favor in states of the West and Middle
West. In their favor it is claimed that they secure economy,
accuracy, better discipline and more equitable appropriations,
introduce business methods, relieve the heads of schools from
financial problems, visit other states, and keep in touch with
the people. See University of Nebraska Studies, Oct., 1905.
The evolution of state control is also here traced. See also
Bulletin of Ohio Board of Charities, Dec., 1908, xiv., 6.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_282_282" id="Footnote_282_282"></a><a href="#FNanchor_282_282"><span class="label">[282]</span></a> In nearly all the states the schools were placed at first
in the hands of special boards of trustees, with connection with
no other bodies, and it was only later that any change was
brought about. In some states there have been various experiments
in the organization of governing boards and in the
number of members they were to contain. Several schools
at their beginning have been put under the direction of a
state educational institution, as the university in Utah, and
the normal school in Oklahoma. In a few states the schools
have been placed under certain state officers, as in New
Mexico and Oregon. In Washington the first board of trustees
of the school consisted of a physician, a lawyer and a practical
educator.</p></div>

of Columbia and West Virginia are sent to an outside

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_284_284" id="Footnote_284_284"></a><a href="#FNanchor_284_284"><span class="label">[284]</span></a> In regard to the organization of the several boards that
have to do with the education of the deaf, it may be stated
that in some states, as in Ohio and Indiana, the law restricts
the number that may be of any one political party. In connection
with the government of schools for the deaf, the
saddest feature has too often been the political influences
which have been allowed to become factors in the conducting
of some of them. In certain instances the playing of
"politics" has been of serious moment, and with incalculable
harm to the work of the schools. In some cases the administration
of schools has been considered legitimate spoils to the
party in power, and appointments have been made as a matter
of reward, and removals as a matter of punishment. The evil
effect of such procedure it is hard to overestimate, and indeed
in an enlightened land it is even difficult of credence. Public
opinion should severely condemn all attempts at political interference
in the work of the education of the deaf, and those
seeking to promote it should be dealt with befittingly. Happily,
however, such conduct seems now on the decline in the
schools, and it may earnestly be hoped that the end is not far

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE DAY SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF</h3>


<h4>Inception and Growth of the Day School</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A small</span> number of the institutions for the
deaf had begun as day schools, the pupils
living away from the school outside school
hours, and had continued so for a longer or
shorter period. The schools were then in an experimental
stage, and this plan came first to
hand. In the course of time it was found that
this feature was not practicable, as the pupils
were often far scattered, and the boarding arrangement
was accordingly adopted.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> This was
the policy finally chosen in all the states having
schools. Later, however, when the states had
grown in population, and in some of the cities
there were found not a few deaf children, the
demand was renewed for day schools.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The result<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
has been the beginning and development of
a system of day schools in a number of states;
and they have come to occupy part of the field
formerly covered by the state institutions alone.</p>

<p>Of the day schools now existing, the Horace
Mann School, of Boston, which was established
in 1869, is accredited with being the initial one.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
Two others were opened before 1890, while from
1891 to 1900 there were 22 started, and since
1901, 40, making 65 in all now.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> These schools
are found in fourteen states, but the movement
has reached its greatest growth in the Middle
West, especially in Wisconsin and Michigan.
In some of the states special laws have been enacted,
providing for the establishment of day
schools.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>


<h4>Design and Scope of Day Schools</h4>

<p>The day school for the deaf is still sometimes
regarded as an experiment, while its advocates
insist that its success has been demonstrated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Among school authorities in cities especially,
pleas for the establishment of day schools are
often listened to with favor, and there is frequently
a tendency to give them at least a trial.
General bodies interested in education or the
public welfare are likewise inclined to countenance
day schools, largely for the reason that they
are opposed to the institution idea, and would
place as many children as possible in the regular
schools. An illustration of this view is found in
the Report on Children of the National Conference
of Charities and Corrections in 1906.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Institutional care of healthy, normal children is
objectionable.... Institutional care for educational
purposes is necessary for a portion of the deaf and
blind children ... but it is recognized that in
large cities public schools can be provided for many deaf
and blind children.</p></div>

<p>By some it is believed that in time the day
school will supplant the large institution, so far
at least as large cities are concerned, and that
the deaf, and the blind as well, will not be differentiated
from the pupils in the regular schools.
Separate apartments and special teachers will be
provided for them, but in all public school systems
these classes will be actual factors.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is maintained that there
is an abundant field for both day school and institution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
The former should only supplement
the work of the latter, especially in reaching
children that cannot otherwise be brought into
school. The reason why the day school is called
into being is thus given by an educational authority
of one city:<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Institutions that care for these children throughout
the entire year, that feed, clothe and educate them, that
render skilful and prompt medical attention, and afford
uplifting social advantages&mdash;all under one roof&mdash;have
a worthy place under our social and educational
systems; but these institutions cannot care for all the
unfortunate children in need of education.</p></div>

<p>It is also suggested that it might be arranged
that day schools should keep pupils during their
early years, as from five to nine years of age,
after which time they could enter the institution,
and be placed in graded classes and in a suitable
trade school.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Hence it is pointed out that the
day school and institution should not be antagonistic,
that their interests are common at bottom,
and that they should work hand in hand, without
friction or misunderstanding.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>The day school plan has not as yet been followed
in a large number of states; yet as these
schools are being looked upon with more and
more favor by city boards of education, and as
in the centers of population there is said to be
a need for them, it is not improbable that they
may be extended much farther in the future. It
is doubtful, however, if very soon they will spread
beyond the large cities; and states without great
cities may be without such schools for many years
at least.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>


<h4>Extent and Organization of Day Schools</h4>

<p>The day schools, numbering 65 in all, as we
have seen, are found in the states of California,
Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey,
New York, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin.
In Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, Missouri, and Oregon each there is
but one school, in New Jersey and Washington
each 2, in New York 3, in California 4, in Ohio
and Illinois each 5, in Michigan 14, and in Wisconsin
24. Where only one day school is found in
a state, it is located usually in the largest city
(Atlanta, New Orleans, Boston, St. Paul, St.
Louis, and Portland), while the two schools of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
New Jersey are in Newark and Jersey City, the
two of Washington in Seattle and Tacoma, and
the three of New York in New York City. Of
the five schools in Illinois, four are in Chicago.</p>

<p>In six of these states, namely, California,
Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin,
there are special state laws under which
the schools are established and operated.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> By
such laws it is generally provided that where
there are a certain number of deaf children,
usually three,<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> a school may, on application of
the local school trustees or district board, be organized
by the state department of education.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
The minimum age for such children is often three.
A stated sum is frequently allowed for each pupil,
as $150.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> In the remaining eight states the
schools are organized and directed by local school
authorities, without assistance from legislative
statute.</p>

<p>These schools are supported by local funds
or by state and local funds together. The latter
is the more common procedure, and in the case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of schools operating under a state law, it is the
usual, but not the necessary, practice. The
schools in six states, namely, Georgia, Illinois,
Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, and New York,
are thus maintained only by local funds of the
city or county, the remainder receiving aid in
whole or in part from the state.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The school in
Minnesota and one in California are aided by
private contributions. In nearly all cases carfare
is provided to and from school when necessary.</p>

<p>In the day schools special buildings are not
usually provided, separate classes being created
in the regular school buildings; but in some of the
larger cities there are special buildings, known as
distinct schools, in which the class-rooms are for
the different grades of deaf pupils.</p>

<p>The number of pupils in the day schools in
1912-1913 was 1,942. The smallest schools have
but three pupils, while the largest one, in Chicago,
has 307, the number usually depending on the
size of the city. The method employed in the day
schools is exclusively the oral with but two exceptions.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
In all but a few certain industries are
also taught, or more or less of manual training is
given.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<h4>Arguments for the Day School</h4>

<p>The great argument for the day school is
that it is not well that children be "institutionalized."
The institution life is said not to be the
normal life, and its habits and associations are
not in accord with the principles now being
largely held in America. It is coming to be more
and more realized that the home should always
be the center of interest and attachment in the
well established community, and that the character
and influence of the family should be maintained
unimpaired. In connection with orphan
and other child-caring agencies, a greater emphasis
than ever before is being put on the question
of how to reduce the life to one of normality,
and the "placing-out" of dependent children in
homes where they can grow up as normal children
is now a popular faith. The great watchword to-day
in intelligent and constructive philanthropy
is the "ideal of the normal," and it is on this
ground that the institution is declared to be removed
from the standard of the highest interests
of society. Even though a child should profit in
the institution, and even though he should be sent
out into the world strong and self-reliant, yet
while in the institution, he is out of line, and is
just so far displaced from the ideal of the normal;
and even though the institution is cleanlier, more
sanitary and otherwise better equipped than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
quarters from which the child comes, still the
institution cannot be justified, for no solution can
be acceptable if in the end it results in the breaking
up of the home.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>More specific charges are also brought against
the institution. Here life for the inmates is made
too easy, and little can be known by them of the
actual struggles of the world. The life is machine-like,
and all is routine clockwork. By the
discipline, which is necessary, much of the spontaneity
of growing children is destroyed, and the
surroundings are pervaded with the spirit of
uniformity, "solidarity" and "dead levelism."
On the other hand, the children fail to learn many
important lessons in domestic economy which
would be before them every day in the home; and
they lose the attitude towards life, morally and
socially, which is given by the home.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>The arguments for the day school may be
stated more concretely yet. The special day
school may be co-ordinated with, or made a part
of, the state's educational system, standing on a
level with its other schools. Deaf children here
come to feel their place in the normal world, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
people in general become more ready to regard
them in a proper manner. These children at the
same time are not made strangers to their own
family circles and communities; and certain ones,
by a school nearer home and consequently more
acceptable to their parents, may be reached who
would otherwise possibly never enter an institution.</p>

<p>In the way of cost the balance is distinctly on
the side of the day school. With no costly special
plant necessary, and with no charges to be incurred
for food supplies, attendants and the
like, it appears to decided advantage in the matter
of economy in comparison with an institution;
and its normal expenditures approach nearer
those of the regular schools. At present the difference
between the cost per pupil in the day
schools and in the institutions is the difference
between $120 and $277.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<h4>Arguments against the Day School</h4>

<p>The argument against the day school rests
upon the fact that the deaf form, educationally,
a special class, very small in most communities,
who have to be reached by unusual methods. To
them the large institution offers advantages not
likely to be had outside. For this reason the case
against the institution, however cogent and logical
it may be in general, cannot well apply.</p>

<p>In the institution the children may be under
intelligent supervision and direction their entire
time, and they may be able to get, outside school
hours, a part of the education which the hearing
child so naturally acquires, for in an institution
learning continues outside the classroom as well
as within. The "picking up" of knowledge and
bits of information, which the hearing child begins
to make use of from the time he first hears
human words, and the importance and value of
which the general public cannot be expected to
appreciate, is lost in the greatest measure to the
deaf in the home. Here ready means of communication
are lacking, and the necessary care
and attention cannot be expected to be given in
the household. Even though deaf children can
and do mingle with their hearing acquaintances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
they cannot get so much happiness or zest out of
their sports and intercourse as they can with their
own deaf comrades; and while, no matter what
their surroundings are, the difficulties of most of
them in mastering language will never be overcome,
still in associations with similar deaf children
there will be far more stimuli to react on
their consciousness, and the tendency will be for
them to become more and more in their mental
actions like the normal. In the home there can be
no great assurance of study and supervision; and
the growing deaf child, not being able to appreciate
the forces that surround him as the hearing
child does, may the more easily fall under unwholesome
influences. In the institution there
can be suitable discipline, regular attendance, enlightened
general oversight, and co-ordination of
all that is concerned in the child's proper development.
Furthermore, although there may be a
growing feeling against the institution life, there
is, on the other hand, an increasing social questioning
as to the advisability of a child's remaining
in a particular home if his welfare is not
properly safeguarded.</p>

<p>In many day schools there are comparatively
few pupils, and in most of these we cannot expect
to find the carefully graded classes, with a
place for every pupil according to his needs,
bright or dull, quick to learn or slow. A pupil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
in a day school, if not neglected to some extent,
may be required to do work for which he is quite
unfitted, being either beyond it or incapable of it.
The backward child will here be the worst sufferer,
for if there are but few classes, he can get
little of the special attention he needs; and his
progress cannot be the same as when in a class of
like pupils and under an appropriate and patient
teacher.</p>

<p>Again, the attention that is given in an institution
with a considerable number of pupils to the
learning of a trade&mdash;accounting in strong measure
for success in after life&mdash;means much more
to a deaf child than it could to any other. In an
institution there will usually be found larger
equipment, fuller apparatus and more varied
lines than in any but a very large day school; and
in its trade department habits of industry will be
formed, talents developed, a knowledge of mechanism
and the use of tools implanted, an ardor
enkindled for the mastership of a trade, and an
appreciation of the part to be played in the great
world of industrial activity, besides the incentive
of being in a great workshop with other workers&mdash;all
in far greater measure and more effectively
than would be possible anywhere else, save
in a great trade school, in which there could not
be expected to be taken the special care and provision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
necessitated by the want of hearing of the
pupils.</p>

<p>Finally, it may be said that we have no evidence,
as respects institutions for the deaf, to
show that they have in any way undermined the
character or mission of the home, or that their
results have been other than desirable in a well-ordered
state. Hence we are told, in a word,
that no matter how strong and valid are the theoretical
objections to an institution, yet so far as
the practical issues are concerned, in the preparation
of the deaf for the world, and in what really
counts for their development and progress, the
institution, for many at least, occupies a position
of demonstrated usefulness, recognition of which
cannot rightly be withheld.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>


<h4>Evening Day Schools for Adults</h4>

<p>Thus far in this chapter we have discussed day
schools in relation to children, that is, pupils in
the usual sense. But there is another form of
day schools to which attention is to be directed.
This is in the creation of evening day schools for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the use of adults only, the field open to which is
as yet apparently but little realized.</p>

<p>Occasion for such schools arises chiefly in communities,
especially large cities, where a considerable
number of adult deaf persons are within
reach, and where a real need may often be found.
The matter is to be regarded in effect as the extension
of the means of education by the state to
include as large a part of the population as possible&mdash;a
movement which is being so notably evidenced
in the opening of evening schools of not
a few kinds in cities to-day. With the deaf the
demand is of a peculiar nature. Their avenues
for receiving instruction are materially restricted,
and for some, especially the congenitally deaf,
the acquisition of correct language always remains
a difficult problem, while to others the advantages
of the regular schools may have been
limited. A large number of the deaf will not
require such special opportunities, but for a portion
of them the assistance may be of quite substantial
character.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

to be discontinued after a few years, both under private and
under public auspices. In the consideration, however, of any
general scheme for evening schools it should be arranged
that the work of the regular schools for the deaf is not infringed
upon, and that pupils in these schools should not
have before them the temptation of leaving prematurely,
with the expectation of making up later. Probably the safest
plan would be the securing of a satisfactory compulsory attendance
law before evening schools are attempted upon a
broad scale.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>DENOMINATIONAL AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS</h3>


<h4>Denominational Schools</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> addition to the state institutions and the day
schools, there have been established in America
certain schools for the deaf which are
strictly under private management, and, as a
rule, not subject to the immediate control and direction
of the state. These are of two kinds:
1. denominational schools, maintained by some
religious body; and 2. schools conducted as
purely private and secular affairs. Such schools
now number twenty-one, ten denominational and
eleven private, all in 1912-1913 having 638
pupils. Most are of comparatively recent date,
the first having been established in 1873, and
nine since 1901.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>The denominational schools are found in California,
Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan,
Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
there being two in Pennsylvania. They are for
the most part boarding institutions, in a few
cases being departments of larger institutions.
Their controlling purpose is to surround their
pupils with religious influences, and to provide
them with religious instruction. All but one are
under Roman Catholic auspices, as a usual thing
in the hands of the Sisters. The single Protestant
school is in the care of the Lutheran Church,
and is controlled by the synod, with the direct
management vested in a board of trustees.
These schools are supported by denominational
funds, by voluntary contributions, and in a small
measure by tuition fees. In some of the schools,
as in Maryland and Pennsylvania, there is state
aid to a small extent. The fees paid by pupils are
never high, and not many in the schools pay the
full amount, though inability to pay is never allowed
to keep any away who wish to attend.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>


<h4>Private Schools</h4>

<p>The eleven non-denominational schools may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
themselves divided into two classes: those which
are really homes for very young deaf children,
sometimes under the control of a society organized
for the purpose; and those which are purely
private enterprises, owned and directed by one
or more individuals. Of the former there are
four homes or kindergartens&mdash;the Sarah Fuller
Home of Boston, the McCowen Homes of
Chicago, the Home School near Baltimore, and
the Home School of San Francisco.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> Their
main object is to give their pupils an early start
in the use of speech as well as to provide a home,
and children as young as three, or even younger,
may be admitted. The management of these
schools is usually in the hands of trustees. Support
is derived largely from the fees of pupils,
though some schools are often the recipients of
private donations, especially when children are
taken without charge; and one or two have aid
from public allowances.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>The private schools of the second class are almost
entirely dependent on tuition fees, though
one or two likewise receive some state aid.
With two exceptions,<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> they are found in large
cities, New York having two, and Philadelphia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Baltimore and Cincinnati one each. These
schools are both boarding and day schools.</p>

<p>The method employed in the private schools
is nearly always the oral, and this is the method
also of some of the denominational schools. In
some of the schools of both classes manual training
and instruction in trades are given to an
extent.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_305_305" id="Footnote_305_305"></a><a href="#FNanchor_305_305"><span class="label">[305]</span></a> There have been a number of private schools at various
times, perhaps a score or more, which have been discontinued&mdash;besides
those which were the nuclei of the state institutions.
There are, moreover, several private schools for the hard of
hearing, where instruction and practice are offered in lip-reading,
and attended for the most part by adults.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_306_306" id="Footnote_306_306"></a><a href="#FNanchor_306_306"><span class="label">[306]</span></a> Thus in the Michigan Evangelical Lutheran Institute,
where the minimum fee is $10 a month, we are advised that
only two or three pay the full amount. In St. John's Institute
of Wisconsin, where $12 a month is asked, we are
advised that the officials are "contented with whatever part
of this sum the parents or guardians can pay". Voluntary
contributions likewise do not always prove large. Of the Immaculate
Conception Institution of St. Louis, we are advised
that private contributions are "too meagre to support one
child". The industry of the Sisters often adds much for the
maintenance of the Catholic schools.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE NATIONAL COLLEGE</h3>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">After</span> our review of the various schools
that have been created for the deaf in the
United States, we come to what may be regarded
as the culminative feature in the provision
for their instruction&mdash;an institution for their
higher education. In this particular the work
in America stands unique among the nations of
the world. This institution is Gallaudet College&mdash;named
after the founder of the first
school&mdash;which is maintained at Washington by
the national government, and is open to all the
deaf of the country. We have seen how the
national government has rendered very distinct
aid in the work of the education of the deaf; but
in establishing the college it has gone far beyond
this, and by this act may be said to have placed
the capstone upon the structure of their education.</p>

<p>This college has resulted from a school which
was established in the District of Columbia in
1857, known as the Kendall School. Not long
after Congress was asked to create an institution
for the higher education of the deaf as well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and to include all the country. No little interest
was aroused in the matter, and zealous advocates
appeared to present the claims of the new undertaking.
The chief objection was the lack of precedent,
while with some members of Congress
the idea seemed strange of conferring college
degrees upon the deaf. Opposition, however, did
not prove strong, and the measure was finally
enacted in 1864 by a practically unanimous vote.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Thus was the college established, and Congress
continues regularly to provide for it, together
with the Kendall School, both being known as the
Columbia Institution for the Deaf. In the college
there are now provided one hundred full scholarships
for students from the several states of the
Union.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising that this action on the part
of Congress should have been held without a precedent.
In no other instance has the national<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
government attempted to make provision for the
education of any class or part of the inhabitants
of the different states, beyond certain so-called
wards of the nation, as the Indians, for example.
Though the national government has very perceptibly
encouraged learning in many ways,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
yet direct provision for the education of the youth
of the several commonwealths has universally
been regarded as their sole prerogative. In thus
establishing a college for certain residents of the
various states, the federal government has done
something that stands out by itself. Though the
reason lies in the fact that no other means for
the higher education of the deaf seemed at hand,
it would appear that thereby the government has
signally favored the deaf, as it indeed has; and
in taking under its immediate direction this
higher education of the deaf, the national government
has won the gratitude of them all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>PROVISION FOR EDUCATION BY STATES</h3>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Having</span> now considered the plan and organization
of the several kinds of schools
for the deaf in America, namely, the institutions,
the day schools, the private schools and
the national college, we proceed in this chapter to
examine the work in the several states individually,
and to note to what extent and in what manner
the education of the deaf has been provided
for in each.</p>

<p><i>Alabama.</i> A private school was started near
Montgomery in 1854, but was discontinued after
one or two years. The state school was established
at Talladega in 1858.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> In 1891<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> a school
was created for the colored deaf and blind. The
schools are governed by a board of thirteen members,
including the governor and the superintendent
of public instruction.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p><i>Arizona.</i> Before the opening of a local school
the deaf were sent to other states for instruction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
The state school was created in 1912,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
and is a part of the state university. On the admission
of Arizona as a state, 100,000 acres of the
public land were granted for the benefit of the
school for the deaf and the blind.</p>

<p><i>Arkansas.</i> A private school was opened at
Clarksville in 1850, which was moved to Little
Rock in 1861.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> After a suspension, it was
started anew in 1867, and in 1868 was taken over
by the state.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> The school is now in the hands
of the state board of charitable institutions.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p><i>California.</i> The state institution for the deaf
and the blind was established at Berkeley in
1860,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> after a society had been formed for the
purpose. The school is controlled by a board of
five directors, while the state board of charities
supervises.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> There are four day schools in the
state:<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> at Oakland, opened in 1898, and supported<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
by state and county; at Los Angeles in
1899, supported by city and private subscriptions;
at San Francisco in 1901, supported by
the city; and at Sacramento in 1904, supported
by state and city. There is a private school in
Oakland, the St. Joseph's Home, opened in 1895,
and one in San Francisco, the Holden Home
Oral School, opened in 1913.</p>

<p><i>Colorado.</i> The state school was opened at
Colorado Springs in 1874,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> and is for the deaf
and the blind. It is supported by a one-fifth
mill tax on the assessed property valuation of the
state. The school is in the hands of a board of
five trustees, and is connected with the state
board of education.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p><i>Connecticut.</i> The American School was established
at Hartford in 1817.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> At the time
the state made an appropriation of $5,000, and in
1828 began to allow a certain sum for each state
pupil, a policy still continued. The school has
remained a private corporation, and its board is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
made up of eight vice-presidents and eight elected
directors, together with the governors and secretaries
of state of the New England states. In
1819 Congress gave the school 23,000 acres of the
public land, from which almost $300,000 has been
realized. Gifts from private sources have nearly
equalled this, about half coming since 1850.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
A second school is at Mystic, known as the Mystic
Oral School, this having been started in 1870 at
Ledyard, where it remained four years.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> It is
under a board of ten corporators. Both these
schools receive <i>per capita</i> allowances from the
state, and are visited by the state board of charities.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p><i>Delaware.</i> Deaf children are sent to schools
in neighboring states, the first provision having
been made in 1835. The supreme court judges
act as trustees <i>ex-officio</i>, and recommend pupils
to the governor to be placed.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p><i>District of Columbia.</i> The Kendall School, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
it is known, was opened in 1857,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> and was designed
primarily for the children of the District
and of persons in the army and navy service. In
1864<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Congress decided to establish a collegiate
department for the deaf of all the country, which
was first known as the National Deaf-Mute College,
but is now Gallaudet College. The Columbia
Institution, embracing both the college and
the Kendall School, is supported by Congress,
and is in the form of a corporation, of which the
President of the United States is patron, and of
the nine members of which one is a Senator and
two are members of the House.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p><i>Florida.</i> The state school for the deaf and
blind was opened at St. Augustine in 1885.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> It
is now in the hands of the state board of control
of educational institutions, which also directs the
state university.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p><p><i>Georgia.</i> The state began sending some of its
deaf children to the Hartford school in 1834.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
A private school was started at Cedar Springs
in 1842, which continued two years. The state
school was established at Cave Spring in 1846.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
It is under a board of seven trustees.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> There
is a day school in Atlanta, supported by the
city, and a private one at Macon, both opened in
1912.</p>

<p><i>Idaho.</i> Before the opening of a state
school, deaf children were sent to outside institutions.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
The school for the deaf and the blind was
opened at Boise in 1906, but in 1910 was removed
to Gooding. It is under the state board
of education, and subject to other state inspection.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p><i>Illinois.</i> The state school was opened at Jacksonville
in 1846, although steps had been taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
several years before for its establishment.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> The
school is directed by the state board of administration,
while the board of charities has moral
and auditing supervision.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> There are in the
state five day schools, four of which are in
Chicago, the first having been established in 1896,
and the last in 1913. The other day school is at
Rock Island, opened in 1901. All these schools
are operated under the state law, and supported
by city funds.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> In Chicago there are also two
private schools: the Ephpheta, opened in 1884,
and maintained by St. Joseph's Home for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Friendless,<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and the McCowen Homes for Deaf
Children, opened in 1883.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<p><i>Indiana.</i> Prior to the opening of the state
school, some children were sent to Kentucky and
Ohio for education. In 1841 a private school was
started in Parke County, which lasted one year.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>

from the start, and it has probably received
several hundred thousand dollars in gifts.
The governing board is composed of twenty-seven
members.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> The Western Pennsylvania

now $150. For the board of pupils who do not live near the
school, $100 additional is allowed. The first day school in the
state was a private one at Milwaukee, founded in 1878 and
lasting till 1885, when the law was enacted. It was under the
auspices of the Wisconsin Phonological Institute, $15,000 being
contributed for it by a ladies' society, and a city allowance
being made to it in 1883. There have been other day schools
in the state: Manitowac, 1893-1901; Oconto, 1898-1899; Neilsville,
1898-1905; Sparta, 1899-1909; Tomah, 1899-1900;

for the school in 1897, but was set aside for military
purposes. By the act of admission to the Union, 30,000 acres
of land were granted for the school. The income from this
fund in 1910 was $2,849.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS FOR SCHOOLS</h3>


<h4>Extent of Constitutional Provisions</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Not</span> only has provision for the education
of the deaf been consummated in all the
states, but in some of them this provision
has been buttressed, as it were, by a permanent
guarantee in the organic law. This regard, while
not necessary practically for the continuance of
the schools, is none the less commendable,&mdash;and
indeed is one that should be declared in every
state. Such provision concerning the education
of the deaf, more direct in some than in others, is
found in the constitutions of twenty-seven, or a
little over half of the states. These are Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Idaho,
Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North
Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and
West Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>
<p>New York in 1846 was the first state to make
reference thus to a school for the deaf. Michigan,
however, in 1850 was the first state to
provide directly for their education, followed in
1851 by Indiana and Ohio. Of the forty-two
states adopting constitutions since 1846, twenty-seven
have made reference to schools, while fifteen
have failed to do so. Of the twenty states
adopting constitutions since 1889, sixteen have
made such provision.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> It is to be noted, however,
that many of the states with special reference to
the education of the deaf have comparatively recent
constitutions, while in others where no such
provision is found, the present constitutions often
date far back in our national history, and were
adopted before attention had been called to the
needs of the deaf and similar classes. Hence,
in general, it is not to be concluded from the
mere presence or absence of a reference in the
constitution that certain states are more solicitous
than others for the education of their deaf children.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<h4>Language and Forms of Provisions</h4>

<p>The language of these constitutional provisions
for schools for the deaf varies to some extent.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
In all of the constitutions, with the exception of
that in Minnesota, schools for the deaf are
coupled with those for the blind, and unless the
provision is under the caption of "education,"
institutions for the insane are likewise provided
for in the same clause. In several instances there
is more than one reference to the school for the
deaf.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>

<p>The most usual statement is that institutions
for the deaf and dumb, the blind, and the insane

there is an amendment by which the

the several charitable and penal institutions

In New Mexico<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> the school is enumerated

the school is mentioned in connection with the

constitutional provisions have reference to the
subsidies granted to private institutions, it being
stated that "nothing in the constitution shall prevent
the legislature from making such provision
for the education and support of the blind, the
deaf and dumb, and juvenile delinquents ... as
it may deem proper," and that the legislature
is not to be prohibited from action by the
prohibition of the credit or land of the state being
"given to private associations, corporations and
undertakings." In Louisiana<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> a similar, though

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>QUESTION OF THE CHARITY CONNECTION
OF SCHOOLS</h3>


<h4>Institutions Sometimes Regarded as Educational:
Sometimes as Charitable</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> considering the relation of the state to its
schools for the deaf, the question is raised as
to the way they are regarded by the state, and
in what scheme of classification they have been
assigned. We find that with many of the states
the institutions are held to be charitable, and the
further question is presented as to whether this
is proper and just.</p>

<p>In times past this has been the usual classification,
but of late years an increasing number of
states have made a change and now regard the
institutions as merely educational. It would be
difficult to say with precision to what scheme of
classification the schools in the several states
should be ascribed; and in quite a number the
lines shade off one into the other. From what
has been said in the preceding chapters and also
from certain legislative classification, it would
seem that the schools in the following states are
regarded largely, if not entirely, as educational:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, District of Columbia,
Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Mississippi,
Montana, New Jersey, Nevada, New
Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina,
Texas, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia. In
about half of the states, however, the institutions
continue to be regarded as charitable to a greater
or less extent from their connection with charity
boards or from some other classification. Some
are recognized as educational, but at the same
time not held altogether free from the charitable
touch.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>


<h4>Charity in Connection with Schools for the Deaf</h4>

<p>Considerable difficulty at the outset rests with
the word charity. In its best sense, it is the finest
word in our language, and from its springs flow
all benevolence, material and spiritual: when
looked upon scientifically much of the repugnance
and prejudice felt toward it is lost, and it
becomes the touchstone for the remedy of human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
ills. In one sense, education is most surely and
deeply charitable, whether or not it is held to be
but the equipment of the state for its self-preservation.
This has long been accepted, and so unanimously
have the states undertaken the instruction
of their children that its very discussion is
now unknown.</p>

<p>But popularly conceived, charity is still something
doled out and granted by the giver as a
matter of grace, and to the recipient are carried
associations that do not comport with independence
and manliness of character. Besides,
education has long ceased to be thought of as
charitable, and only such institutions as are for
the education of the deaf and blind are left with
the undesirable signification of the word. In
addition, the state maintains institutions for certain
of its classes, as the insane, the feeble-minded
and the infirm, which as a rule are in no sense
educational from our standpoint, and other institutions
of a reformatory, corrective or punitive
character, and with them have to be classed the
institutions for the deaf, all being known as the
state's "charitable institutions," or "state institutions;"
while the public rarely makes discrimination,
or notes the distinctions involved.</p>

<p>The chief trouble, then, in classifying the
schools for the deaf as charitable is this connection
of the word charity, and the grouping of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
deaf with certain other parts of the state's population
which other children do not have to share.
The deaf are thus differentiated from children
who have no defect of sense, and the education of
the one is thus education, and of the other charity.
Schools in which the deaf are educated
would thus seem not to be given their just status.
They are misrepresented by being aligned, on the
one hand, with people of defective or diseased
minds, and on the other, with the state's delinquent
and criminal classes. The deaf thus become
wards of the state, and constitute one of its
dependent classes. They are "inmates" of an
"eleemosynary" institution, and the fact that it
is all for education is lost sight of.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>But, we are told, the treatment of deaf children
should rest upon an altogether different basis,
and they should, even in appearance, receive an
education as a right and as nothing else. Education
as the paramount privilege of American
children is so deeply established in American institutions
and character that it would seem to be
a principle to be applied to all the children of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
state. Admission into schools for the deaf has
become more and more like that in the regular
schools.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> The schools are open, as a general
rule, only to those able and fitted to be educated,
and the mentally and physically disqualified are
often rejected. When a child has completed the
prescribed number of years of attendance, he can
be provided for no longer, and at vacation time
in nearly all schools he must depart. The schools,
as we are to see, have become free to all, while
compulsory education laws have also been made
to apply. Hence if schools for the deaf are educational,
they can be regarded as charitable only
to the extent that all schools are so considered;
they should not be looked upon in a different
light, and the public should be as fully alive to
their claims.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>
<h4>Arguments for the Connection with the Boards
of Charities</h4>

<p>Hitherto we have been discussing the theory
in regard to the proper place in which the institutions
are to be held, but we are now to see what
are the actual grounds upon which the connection
with the state board of charities is to be justified.
Much might be said of the practical workings of
schools in connection with such boards, and it is
claimed that the schools get the substance at least
in the way of beneficial treatment. By one superintendent
it has been stated thus: "In theory
it is all wrong, but in practice it could not be
improved upon." Where the boards are composed
of capable, broad-minded, sympathetic
men, the needs of the schools can be satisfactorily
looked into, and their experience with other institutions,
where the problems are akin in the way
of housing a large number of people, can be
utilized to great advantage, especially in connection
with sanitary, hospital and other arrangements.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
Such boards may secure supplies on
more favorable terms, may systematize all the institutions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
may properly apportion the appropriations
to be asked of the legislature, may exercise
a wider supervision, and may correlate all the
means of the state for the maintenance of certain
classes of its population. These boards may also
have peculiar opportunities for coming across
poor and neglected children and of getting them
in the schools. Lastly, and most important of all,
even though the institutions are educational,
there is much also to be considered besides education
alone, for a home and board are furnished
during the school year, and usually transportation
and clothing as well to those in need of
them.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>By the boards of charity themselves the institutions
are not necessarily regarded as charitable.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
Many of them hold the institutions to
be educational, despite the charity connection,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and few are unwilling to give recognition to their
educational features. In none is there a desire
to injure or stigmatize the deaf. The aim is to
consider the matter in its practical bearings, and
the question is held to be largely one of classification
and administration. With all the fact
weighs that board, lodging, etc., are given entirely
free.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> The clearest and fullest presentation
of the point of view of the charity boards is
given in the following extract from a letter by
one board:<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The institutions are doubtless both educational and
charitable, or at least ought to be, using these words
in their ordinary application. It is not a question of
merit or demerit on the part of the unfortunates or
their families. It is not a question whether they are
entitled to an education as much as normal children.
So far as there is any real issue, it is one of classification
for purposes of administration. The question seems to
be whether the institutions that care for the above mentioned
classes can best be administered under the department
of charities that has charge of public institutions,
or the department of education that usually has to do
with institutions that furnish education only in the
limited technical sense, where pupils attend school a few
hours a day, but are not boarded at the institutions.
Because an institution is an educational institution, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
think it may be none the less a charitable institution.
For example, it would hardly be denied that an orphan
asylum is a charitable institution; yet an orphan asylum
that was not an educational institution would be deplorable.
In the state institutions for the deaf and the
blind, throughout the country, the educational side is
very properly emphasized.... These inmates
would properly be classed as public dependents as they
usually have been.... The whole trouble seems to
arise from a feeling of aversion to the word "charity",
and probably the word has been degraded....
To refer to the institutions under consideration as
"educational institutions", without any qualification,
would not be in the interest of clearness of thought, and
would either lead to confusion or to some qualifying
phrases, because the deaf and the blind are certainly
different enough from the normal child to be considered,
for many purposes, in a separate class, and the institutions
which educate and support them, it would seem
to me, need some term by which they can be designated,
which would distinguish them from the educational
institutions designed for the normal child.</p></div>


<h4>Arguments in Opposition to the Connection</h4>

<p>Yet over against all the arguments for the
connection with the boards of charities the voice
of the educators of the deaf is in unison that the
connection of the schools be completely severed
with whatever is of charitable signification.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
This feeling cannot all be ascribed to the prejudice
regarding the words employed. In the dissolving
of the charity connection an issue not to
be disregarded is the moral effect on the public.
A right conception is to be obtained respecting
the education of the deaf, and while in the schools
and in after life they are entitled to the recognition
of the true character of this education and of
their status in the community. If the deaf after
they have left the schools have shown that they
are capable of wrestling unaided with the difficulties
of life, and are really not objects of charity
at all, then they should be spared all discriminating
associations. Indeed, as our new view
of charity is the making of men capable of standing
alone, and economic units of gain in society,
so the deaf should not be considered as a distinct
or dependent class, when by the use of certain
expressions this is done; and we should hold that
if their work in the world has justified them, then
no barriers should be raised which their fellows
in society do not have to meet, and that their education
should be offered to them without discrimination
or stigma.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>
<p>The benefits derived from the relation with
the board of charities may be more than offset
by the connection with educational agencies,
where the school is recognized as part of the
state's educational system. In respect to the
providing of maintenance for the pupils, this can
be regarded as but an incidence, when any other
plan would be impracticable. The main, overshadowing
purpose in the work of the institutions
is education, and what are supplied beyond
are only to render this the more effective. But
after all this is said, the opponents of the charity
connection insist that the burden of proof is upon
those who advocate the connection. Why, they
ask, should the deaf children of the state who are
as capable of being educated as others be considered
objects of the state's charity? Why any
more than other children?</p>

<p>The feeling in the matter may be indicated by
two declarations on the subject, one by the educators
of the deaf, and the other by the deaf themselves.
The first is in the form of a resolution
adopted by the Convention of American Instructors:<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Resolved</i>, that the deaf youth of our land unquestionably
deserve, and are lawfully entitled to, the same
educational care and aid as their more fortunate
brothers and sisters; and that this education, the constitutional
duty of the state, should be accorded them as
a matter of right, not of charity, standing in the law,
as it is in fact, a part of the common school system.</p></div>

<p>The second is a resolution adopted by the National
Association of the Deaf:<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Whereas</i>, the privilege of an education is the birthright
of every American child ...; and</p>

<p><i>Whereas</i>, the deaf child ... has the same inalienable
right to the same education as his more fortunate
hearing brother; and</p>

<p><i>Whereas</i>, ... the [modern] movement ...
[is] giving schools for the deaf their proper place as
part of the public school system of the country; and</p>

<p><i>Whereas</i>, ... eighty-one per cent [of the deaf
are] gainfully employed of those who have had schooling,
thus indicating the value of education ...;
therefore be it</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, ... that education of the deaf on the
part of the state is simply fulfillment of its duty as a
matter of right and justice, not sympathetic charity
and benevolence to the deaf; ... that schools for
the deaf should not be known and regarded, nor classified,
as benevolent or charitable institutions, ...
[but] as strictly educational institutions, a part of the
common school system ... [and not with such associations
as] tend to foster a spirit of dependence in
the pupils and mark them as the objects of charity of
the state....</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>


<h4>Conclusions in Respect to the Charity Connection
of Schools for the Deaf</h4>

<p>Certain inferences or conclusions may now be
reached regarding our question as to whether
schools for the deaf may be regarded and classified
as charitable.</p>

<p>1. In America the schools have been regarded
both as educational and charitable, but there is
an increasing tendency to consider them as purely
educational. At present about half of the states
hold them entirely or in the main as educational.</p>

<p>2. The state boards or public authorities that
regard the schools as charitable are in no wise
prompted by any desire to discriminate against
the deaf, or to deny that they are less capable
or worthy of education than others. The question
is held to be mainly one of administration.</p>

<p>3. Inasmuch as board and a home are provided
in the institutions, and in some cases clothing
and transportation also, the charitable element
is present, and in point of fact the schools
must be regarded <i>ad hoc</i> as charitable.</p>

<p>4. This charitable feature, however, plays a
slight and almost negligible part in the work of
the schools, being in fact only incidental, and the
educational aims take precedence over all else.</p>

<p>5. Because of the associations involved in the
charity connection, which are not shared in by the
regular schools, and because of the little to suggest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
charity in the after lives of the deaf, the
schools for the deaf have reason to protest against
the connection. As education is the one purpose
of the schools, and as their operations are conducted
solely to this end, they are entitled to an
educational classification.</p>

<p>6. That the schools for the deaf should thus
be held and treated, to the farthest possible extent,
as purely educational, is demanded both by
justice and by the regard for the proper effect on
the deaf and on the public.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_507_507" id="Footnote_507_507"></a><a href="#FNanchor_507_507"><span class="label">[507]</span></a> Thus, in addition to the states named above, in the constitutions
of Michigan, Oklahoma and Virginia the institutions
are designated educational. In certain states also, as we have
seen, the state superintendent of public instruction is <i>ex-officio</i>
member of the governing board, and in a few other
states report is made to the department of education. In
New York and North Carolina the schools are visited by this
department. In a number also an educational classification
is found in some of the statutory references or captions. See
in particular on this subject, <i>Annals</i>, xlviii., 1903, p. 348;
lviii., 1913, p. 327.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_508_508" id="Footnote_508_508"></a><a href="#FNanchor_508_508"><span class="label">[508]</span></a> The earlier conception of the schools is in part illustrated
by the name "asylum" given. British schools were often
called asylums or hospitals, and were largely founded and supported
by charity. Likewise in America the term "asylum"
was frequently given to the schools when first started. But
the name has now been generally discarded, and in but one
state is the title retained, New Mexico. "School" is now
mostly used, while in a few "institution" is employed. See
<i>Annals</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i> See also Report of Board of Penal, Pauper
and Charitable Institutions of Michigan, 1878, p. 41.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_509_509" id="Footnote_509_509"></a><a href="#FNanchor_509_509"><span class="label">[509]</span></a> In Massachusetts appropriations were once "for beneficiaries
in asylums for the deaf and dumb", but now they are
"for the education of deaf pupils in schools designated by
law".</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_510_510" id="Footnote_510_510"></a><a href="#FNanchor_510_510"><span class="label">[510]</span></a> In a legal sense, nearly all educational institutions can
be called charitable, especially if they are private affairs, and
gifts for such purposes are held in the law as for charitable
purposes. See 4 Wheaton, 518; 2 How. (U. S.), 227; 14 How.,
277; 44 Mo., 570; 25 O. St., 229. Not many cases have arisen
in regard to the status of institutions for the deaf. In 1900
the Columbia Institution was held in the opinion of the
Attorney-General to be under the department of charities, but
Congress the next year declared it to be educational. See
<i>Annals</i>, xlvi., 1901, p. 345. In Colorado an opinion was rendered
that the school was educational alone, and not subject to
the civil service rules, and this was later ratified in the constitution
and by the legislature. Some of the courts have
been inclined to view the institutions as charitable. In Nebraska
the school for the deaf was at first considered an asylum
and in the same class with almshouses, rather than educational.
6 Neb., 286. See also 43 Neb., 184. In New York the
provision of the law allowing the State Board of Charities to
inspect the Institution for the Blind was attacked, and it was
held that, though the institution was partly educational and
was visited by the department of education, yet the word
charity was to be taken in its usual meaning, and if the
institution as a private body educated, clothed and maintained
indigent pupils, it was charitable. 154 New York, 14 (1897).</p></div>

indigent or unprotected.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_513_513" id="Footnote_513_513"></a><a href="#FNanchor_513_513"><span class="label">[513]</span></a> In order to discover how these institutions are regarded by
the departments of charities, letters of inquiry were sent by
the writer to all the states of the Union. Replies were received
in 45 out of 49 cases, coming from boards of charities,
boards of control, or in their absence from commissioners of
education or other state officials,&mdash;and in a few cases from
individuals or societies to whom the communication was
turned over. In the answers, the institutions were called
charitable by 6, educational by 13, both charitable and educational
by 12, while by 14 the question was not specifically answered.
In some instances, these replies were only private
opinions, but they represent none the less the views of those
most in touch with the charity activities of the states. In a
few cases the replies were at variance with what has been
accepted regarding certain states. It was also found that
boards of control do not necessarily consider the institutions
as charitable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_514_514" id="Footnote_514_514"></a><a href="#FNanchor_514_514"><span class="label">[514]</span></a> By one board, while such schools are admitted to be partly
educational, they are held "charitable in that they afford a
home for certain defective persons during the time of their
dependence". By one board the pupils are called "charity
patients".</p></div>

any but a strictly educational character. Of the Michigan
school it is expressly stated that it is "not an asylum, reformatory
or hospital"; of the Colorado that it is "not an
'asylum' or 'home' for the afflicted; it is not a hospital for
the care and treatment of the eyes and ears; and it is not a
place for the detention and care of imbeciles"; of the Illinois
that it is "not a reformatory, poor house, hospital or asylum";
of the Indiana that it is "not an asylum, place of refuge, reform
school, almshouse, children's home or hospital"; of the
Georgia that it is "in no sense an asylum ... or charitable
institution"; and of the Mississippi that it is "in no sense an
asylum ... a home ... [nor a place] for medical treatment."

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>PROVISIONS CONCERNING ADMISSION OF
PUPILS INTO SCHOOLS</h3>


<h4>Rules as to the Payment of Fees</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Hitherto</span> we have considered the several
forms of provision for the schools
for the deaf, and the general treatment
accorded them. We now turn our examination
to the schools themselves in their relation to the
pupils who enter them. Our first concern is with
the provisions as to the admission of pupils into
the schools.</p>

<p>We find that the schools, to all intents and purposes,
are free to all applicants mentally and
physically qualified to enter.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> Usually, when
started, the schools were free to the indigent only,
though some, especially in the West, were made
free to all from the very beginning. However,
there was little attempt to observe closely these
limitations, and in time, as we have seen, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
were for the most part given up.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> At present
limitations of any kind are found in the smaller
number of states, and exist in these in form rather
than in practice, so that to-day laws or regulations
of a restrictive nature may be regarded as
but nominal.</p>

<p>In all the states the schools are by statute free
to the indigent at least, and in less than a score
is there a regulation short of universal admittance
prescribed. By the wording of the statute, either
directly or by implication, it would seem to be
indicated that the schools, or, in their absence,
the proper public authorities, in the following
states were still empowered to demand a charge in
whole or in part from those able to pay: Alabama,
Arizona, Delaware, District of Columbia,
Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico,
Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and
Virginia&mdash;these states at least making reference
in some place to the indigent.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> But with or without
such reference, as we have noted, in but few
instances is there a charge to any, indigent or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
not.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> In some states proof of indigence is still
formally necessary,<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> and in others payment may
be made if desired.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>Little effort, then, is made to collect fees in
American schools for the deaf. The circumstances
of the deaf themselves are usually such
as to demand for them education without cost;
while at the same time the general American
feeling that education should be a free gift of
the state to its youth would be sufficient to prevent
attempts to secure payment, even if such
action should be considered proper.</p>


<h4>Provision for Collateral Support of Pupils</h4>

<p>The state thus supplies the means for the education
and maintenance of pupils without cost to
them; but to insure the attendance of those who
by reason of poverty might be prevented from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
availing themselves of its bounty, it assists even
further. Where no other means are provided,
clothing and transportation to and from the
schools are furnished free of expense. Such
charges are usually paid by the counties from
which the pupils come, though a few states undertake
this directly. A given sum may be allowed
for this purpose, or the actual cost may be collected.<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>


<h4><a name="Age_Limits_of_Attendance" id="Age_Limits_of_Attendance"></a>Age Limits of Attendance</h4>

<p>With most of the schools the age limits of attendance
are fixed, and pupils may be admitted
only within the time prescribed by the law. In
some the age permitted is the common school age;
in others pupils are admitted who are of "suitable
age and qualifications," or "capacity;" and in
some cases, no limits being set down, the matter
seems to be left to the discretion of the authorities.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>
<p>In schools where the limits of attendance are
specified, the minimum age is usually six, seven
or eight, while a few schools admit at five. In
a few of the day schools, and in most of the oral
home schools, children may be received as early
as three, or even two, to make an early beginning
in the use of speech, some of the home schools being
designed expressly to receive children under
five, or before the regular school period. The age
limit for the completion of the school period is
often twenty or twenty-one, while a few schools
may keep pupils longer, as to twenty-five. The
most frequent age period at present, where age
limits are stated, is from six to twenty-one, but the
period often begins and ends at other ages.<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>
<p>In some cases pupils are allowed to remain a
certain number of years, but none beyond a certain
limit, while in many the period may be extended
two, three or five years, when it appears
that the progress of the pupil justifies a more
protracted residence.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Finally, it is to be noted
that the limits of attendance have in general been
lowered, and have been made to conform more
and more with those of the regular schools.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_519_519" id="Footnote_519_519"></a><a href="#FNanchor_519_519"><span class="label">[519]</span></a> Certain of the schools receive a few pay pupils, but these
are usually from outside the state or are otherwise exceptionally
provided for. Receipts from such sources are inconsiderable,
and have little effect on the revenues of the schools. According
to the Census of Benevolent Institutions of 1905, less than
$55,000 came to the schools in this way, the greater amount
being for pupils of other states.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_520_520" id="Footnote_520_520"></a><a href="#FNanchor_520_520"><span class="label">[520]</span></a> The statutes of some states, as of Maine and Massachusetts,
even go so far as distinctly to declare that no discrimination
shall be made on account of wealth. On this
subject, see Report of Clarke School, 1885, p. 8.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_521_521" id="Footnote_521_521"></a><a href="#FNanchor_521_521"><span class="label">[521]</span></a> In Florida tuition at least seems to be provided free by the
statute, and in Georgia free admission seems to be provided
only for the indigent blind, while education is made free to
all the deaf. On this subject, see <i>American Journal of Sociology</i>,
iv., 1898, p. 51ff.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_522_522" id="Footnote_522_522"></a><a href="#FNanchor_522_522"><span class="label">[522]</span></a> On this subject the superintendent of the Mississippi
School addressed letters to heads of Southern schools, and
found only two&mdash;those in Texas and Mississippi&mdash;having any
requirement as to payment. In Mississippi there had been
only two payments in the course of a considerable number of
years. In the Texas school for the year 1909 we find the sum
of $1,546 collected as a "reasonable amount" for board,&mdash;an
unusual item in the receipts of a school.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_523_523" id="Footnote_523_523"></a><a href="#FNanchor_523_523"><span class="label">[523]</span></a> Wherever a formal regulation is stated, we are advised
that the schools are "free to the indigent", "free if parents
are unable to pay", "free under certain circumstances", etc.
In a few states, "certificates of inability" have been demanded.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_524_524" id="Footnote_524_524"></a><a href="#FNanchor_524_524"><span class="label">[524]</span></a> In Maine, for instance, the law states that the school is
free, "provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall
be held to prevent the voluntary payment of the whole or
part of such sum by the parent or the guardian".</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_525_525" id="Footnote_525_525"></a><a href="#FNanchor_525_525"><span class="label">[525]</span></a> Some states, notably Washington, Minnesota, Mississippi,
South Carolina, Arkansas, Utah, Nebraska, and Oklahoma allow
funds to pay the transportation of students who enter the
college at Washington, and in some cases an even further allowance
is made. In Minnesota and Nebraska, for instance,
the amount is $300 a year. See <i>Annals</i>, lvi., 1911, p. 180.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_526_526" id="Footnote_526_526"></a><a href="#FNanchor_526_526"><span class="label">[526]</span></a> Even where the age period is fixed by law, it is not always
rigidly adhered to, and considerable elasticity may be allowed.
Of the Michigan school we are told that the state "wisely
allows the board of trustees the privilege of admitting those
[pupils] who are older or younger, if they see fit". Report,
1908, p. 32. For discussion of the age period, see Report of
New York Institution for Improved Instruction, 1870, p. 28;
Ohio School, 1872, p. 17; Clarke School, 1888, p. 8; American
School, 1893, p. 32; Michigan School, 1894, p. 22; New
Jersey School, 1898, p. 20; Pennsylvania Institution, 1901, p.
35; Proceedings of Convention of American Instructors, xviii.,
1908, p. 156; <i>Association Review</i>, v., 1903, p. 380.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_527_527" id="Footnote_527_527"></a><a href="#FNanchor_527_527"><span class="label">[527]</span></a> The formal age period is from 6 to 21 in Colorado, Florida,
Idaho, Maryland, Montana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and
Washington; from 7 to 21 in Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska and
New Mexico; 7 to 25 in Georgia and North Dakota; 7 to 20 in
Wisconsin; 8 to 20 in Minnesota; 8 to 21 in Indiana; 8 to 25
in West Virginia; 8 to 26 in California; 5 to 21 in Iowa and
Maine; 5 to 20 in Vermont; and in North Carolina at one
school 6 to 21, and at the other 8 to 23. In Alabama pupils between
the ages of 7 and 21 may remain 10 years, with an extension
of 4, but none beyond 25. In Arkansas the limits are 6
and 21, and the time of residence may be extended to 13 years.
In Texas they are 7 and 20, with a residence of 12 years permitted.
In Missouri they are 8 and 21, with a residence of
12 years. In Kentucky and Virginia they are the same, with
a residence of 10 years. In Rhode Island they are 3 and 20,
with a stay of 10 years, which may be extended. In New
Jersey the limits are 8 and 21, and a pupil is entitled to a stay
of 8 years, which may be extended 3, and 3 more in addition.
In Louisiana the limits are 8 and 22, pupils under 14
being allowed to stay 10 years; between 14 and 17, 8; and
over 17, 5&mdash;with an extension in each case of 4 years.
In Delaware a pupil may stay 5 years, with a further extension
of 5. In Ohio the lower limit is 7, and none may remain
more than 13 years. In New York pupils may enter at 5, but
after 12, the period is 5 years, with an extension of 3, and a
further one of 3. In Wyoming pupils may enter at 6; and in
Connecticut at 6, with a residence of 12 years and an extension
of 6. In Massachusetts a residence of 10 years is permitted,
which may be extended, but here the Clarke School has no
fixed time, and the Horace Mann takes pupils over 5. In Pennsylvania,
though the statute seems to have provided from 10 to
20 years as the period, there are no strict limits, the Pennsylvania
Institution receiving from 5 to 21, the Western Pennsylvania
from 6 to 20, and the Pennsylvania Oral none under
6, except in special circumstances. In Utah there seems to be
only an upper limit of 30.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_528_528" id="Footnote_528_528"></a><a href="#FNanchor_528_528"><span class="label">[528]</span></a> It sometimes happens that there are found a small number
of deaf persons who are beyond the age allowed, but who are
in need of a certain amount of schooling. Their condition is
said to be "due to their environments, to merciless and exacting
parents, to sickness, and to other causes." Report of
Iowa School, 1812, p. 13. See also Report, 1910, p. 8. Under
special arrangements, some of these might be benefited no
little by a few years of instruction. In Iowa such persons
may now be received up to the age of thirty-five, if the State
Board of Control consents.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_529_529" id="Footnote_529_529"></a><a href="#FNanchor_529_529"><span class="label">[529]</span></a> We have already noticed that in the first schools an early
age was not insisted upon, some pupils entering at 10 or 12,
while their attendance was also of short duration. The
period was often from 9 to 30. The latter age has been allowed
in some states till recent years, as in Texas, Arkansas
and Missouri. It may be stated here that the law as to residence
applies usually only at the time of entrance, and the
removal of the parent may not always effect a change. For a
case in point, see 4 R. I., p. 587.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>ATTENDANCE IN SCHOOLS</h3>


<h4>The Proportion of the Deaf in the Schools</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> question now arises as to whether the
deaf generally attend these schools provided
for them. This inquiry really resolves
itself into two parts: how far the deaf have
at some time and for a longer or shorter period
had recourse to the schools; and how far they
may be found to be in attendance at a given time.
The one has relation rather to how widely the
schools are extending their educational opportunities,
and the other to how effectively they
are accomplishing their ends.</p>

<p>As to the first consideration, the schools are
found to reach most of the deaf children with the
privileges of an education to a greater or less extent.
From the returns of the census<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> we find
that nearly four-fifths (78.4 per cent) of the deaf
have attended school, over three-fourths (77.5
per cent) of these having attended the special
schools. The proportion would be greater still
but for the number of the deaf too young to enter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
school. The proportion of the deaf of school
age who have attended school may likewise be
estimated by comparing the total number of approximate
school age with the number who were
reported to have been in attendance. There were,
according to the census, 13,905 deaf children from
five to twenty years of age. Of these, 10,640, or
76.5 per cent, were reported to have attended
school.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> In 1912-1913 the total number in attendance
was 14,474, which probably means a
higher proportion. On the whole, then, it would
seem that, in respect to the number of deaf children
actually reached at one time or another, the
schools make a really commendable showing,
and one that is becoming better from year to
year.</p>

<p>The second matter, however, cannot be disposed
of nearly so satisfactorily. It is difficult
to determine with any approach to exactness the
respective proportions of the deaf in the several
states of school age who are out of school. The
census does not give us definite information on
this point; and though the school authorities
themselves are usually aware of conditions in
their respective states, they seldom have the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
means of fully ascertaining. But we may learn
something of the general situation. In the reports
of some of the schools complaint is not infrequently
made as to the number of deaf children
out of school who should be in, and in a
portion the number is said to be large.<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> The proportions,
furthermore, found in attendance in the
different states in comparison with their total
population, or with their total deaf population
under twenty years of age, indicate that the attendance
in some states is far greater than in
others, which means that in the latter a relatively
smaller part are in school.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> It would appear,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
then, that the number of the deaf out of school
who are of school age is probably not negligible in
any of the states, and that in some it is very considerable.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p>The fact that the schools do not have their full
quota of pupils is not all due to the refusal of
deaf children to avail themselves of the opportunity
for a schooling. It is in good part owing
also to the failure of some of the pupils who attend
to remain a sufficient length of time. In the
preceding chapter we have seen what are the
limits of attendance prescribed in the schools; but
as a matter of fact a large proportion of the
pupils do not remain the full period allotted, and
in some of the schools an appreciable number do
not remain the better or a substantial part of the
term.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> As in all schools, there is in the passing
of the pupils from the years of childhood an increasing
tendency to leave, and with the deaf
this applies with no less force;<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> so that on no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
small portion of the pupils the work of the schools
is not permitted to have full effect.</p>


<h4>The Need of Compulsory Education Laws for the
Deaf</h4>

<p>It is thus quite evident, however large the true
proportion of the deaf who attend the school
may be, and whatever the proportion remaining
a satisfactory period may be, that in practically
every state there are a certain number of deaf
children not in the schools who should be there,
and that the offer of the state to provide an education
for all its deaf children is not availed of as
it should be.<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> For the existence of this condition
of affairs the schools are not to be held
responsible. They are usually doing all they can
to get the children in, and all the deaf if they
will may receive an education. The cause lies
further back: most often in the ignorance or
short-sightedness of the parent.</p>

<p>For it all there is but one remedy&mdash;the enactment
of a strong compulsory education law and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
its uncompromising enforcement. No matter
how strenuous and diligent may be the efforts
to reach the children,<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> it is only when such a law
is on the statute books that the state's really effective
weapon is at hand to secure attendance.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>However urgent are the needs of compulsory
education laws for children generally, there are
special reasons for them with the deaf. The deaf
stand in particular need of an education, and
without it their condition is peculiarly helpless
and pitiable. Compelling reason is also found in
the fact that, besides the ordinary schooling, industrial
training is likewise afforded to the deaf,
which is hardly possible elsewhere, and which may
mean no little towards success in after life. Even
though it sometimes seems hard to take a deaf
child from his home, and separate him from his
parents for a number of months at a time, especially
if the child is in his tender years, the
greater necessity of the law is but indicated if
such children are to be kept from growing up in
ignorance. The hardship in separation is rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
apparent only and is temporary, while the gains
are not to be measured.</p>

<p>Not only should the deaf child be required to
attend school, but for reasons equally strong it
should be seen that he remains at school a sufficient
number of years, and a sufficient length
of time each year. It is a difficult matter
as it is to secure full attendance, but too often
also the temptation is at hand for pupils to leave
early to take up work on their own account, or
because the school routine seems irksome; and
too often is a pupil called away to help on the
farm or in the shop by what is sometimes hardly
less than the greed of the parent, or by what is
sometimes miscalled his poverty. The state
should allow nothing at all to stand in the way of
the child's best interests.</p>


<h4>Present Extent of Compulsory Education Laws</h4>

<p>How important are compulsory education laws
for the deaf is being generally seen, and the demand
has become practically unanimous for their
enactment, the feeling not being confined to educators
of the deaf but shared in by others interested
in them.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> Such laws have begun to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
their way upon the statute books, and are now
being increasingly enacted. Already practically
half of the states have them, nearly all of which
were enacted since 1900. In other states the matter
is also being agitated, with the likelihood that
provisions will be extended to them in time.
States with such laws now number at least
twenty-three: California, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana,
Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New
Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota,
Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>With respect to the provisions of these
statutes, we find that in some cases the general
compulsory education law applies with its age-periods,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
fines, etc., while in others there are special
enactments for the deaf. In most states an
exception is made if there is instruction at home,
or with equal facilities, and at the same time and
in the same branches. In certain ones truancy
officers are expressly designated to enforce the
law.<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Fines for violation are placed at sums
varying from $5 to $200.<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> The period of attendance
required may be the school year, but
more often a part, as five, six or eight months;<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
and the term for which attendance is required is
either a designated number of years, as five or
eight, or a period between certain age limits, as
from eight to sixteen or from seven to eighteen,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>METHODS OF INSTRUCTION IN SCHOOLS</h3>


<h4>The Use of Signs as a Means of Communication</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Deaf</span> children cannot be educated as other
children, and in the schools there have to
be employed special means of instruction.
In the present chapter it is our purpose to consider
these methods only as they represent, in a
complete study of the provision of the state for
the education of the deaf, the means which have
been found necessary to employ to attain this
end.</p>

<p>From the beginning of organized instruction
of the deaf in America a system of signs has been
in use to a wide extent. At the time when the
methods of instruction of the deaf were introduced
into the first schools, the "sign language"
was brought in as an essential part from France,
where it had largely been formulated. Modified
somewhat and considerably enlarged&mdash;and in conjunction
with the manual alphabet, of Spanish
origin&mdash;the system has taken its place as a recognized
means of education and communication in
the great number of the schools. The deaf themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
after passing from the doors of the schools
have employed the sign language mainly in their
intercourse with one another, and with most of
them meetings and social affairs are conducted
virtually entirely in this manner. Thus the sign
language has for long been one of the vehicles&mdash;usually
the chief vehicle&mdash;of communication
among the deaf and their instructors.</p>

<p>With the sign language for practical use goes
the manual alphabet, or "finger-spelling," by
which the several letters of the alphabet are represented
on the hand, the two together really constituting
the language.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> The order of signs itself
forms to an extent a universal language. It
consists of gestures, bodily movements, mimic actions,
pantomime, postures&mdash;and to carry a close
shade of meaning, even the shrugging of
shoulders, the raising of eyebrows and the expression
of the face&mdash;all appealing graphically to the
accustomed eye. The signs of which it is made up
are partly natural, and partly arbitrary or conventional;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
and the whole system as now practiced
has been codified, as it were, for experienced
users. By the deaf it can be employed rapidly
and with ease, and is readily and clearly understood.
Many of them become such masters of
this silent tongue that it may be used with grace,
warmth and expressiveness.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>


<h4>Rise and Growth of the Oral Movement</h4>

<p>This system of signs, however, has not been
looked upon with favor by all parties. The
"sign language" is said to be a foreign language,
known and understood by only a very small part
of the population, standing as a great barrier to
the acquisition of language used by people generally,
and tending to make the deaf of a class
apart or "clannish." In its place in the schools
would be substituted what is known as the "oral
method," and speech and lip-reading would be
used as the means of instruction. It has been
sought thus to give all the schools over to the
oral method, and summarily to drive out the sign
language.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>
<p>Though the system of signs has been used in
America as the prevailing method from the beginning,
it cannot be said that speech-teaching had
not been employed at all in the early days. Several
schools had started out as oral schools,<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> and
in others speech had been employed to a greater
or less extent.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> But in none of the schools had
the oral method been retained to the exclusion
of all others.</p>

<p>In time, however, attempts were made to secure
the adoption of a pure oral system. Attention
was called especially to Germany, which had
long been known as the home of this method, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
it was sought to introduce it into America.<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> In
1843 Horace Mann and Dr. Samuel G. Howe
visited that country, and on their return reported
in favor of the oral method, though no change
was then brought about.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>A few years later the matter was further agitated,
and in 1864 an effort was made to have an
oral school incorporated in Massachusetts, but
without success. A small oral school was then
started at Chelmesford in 1866, which after a
short time was removed to Northampton, having
been very liberally endowed, and becoming
known as the Clarke School. In 1867 the legislature
decided to incorporate this, and to allow
some of the state pupils to be sent to it.</p>

<p>In the meantime&mdash;in fact, seven months prior
to the actual establishment of the Clarke School&mdash;a
school which had resulted from a private class
had been started in New York City, known as
the New York Institution for the Improved Instruction
of Deaf-Mutes. This was under a former
Austrian teacher, and its stated purpose was
to use the oral method as in Germany. Two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
years later the school board of Boston, having
made a canvass of the deaf children of the city,
resolved to establish a day school, which was to be
a pure oral one, and which not long after was
called the Horace Mann School. These three
schools were thus the pioneers in the present oral
movement.<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>The oral method has gained ground steadily
since these times. It is now used exclusively in
twelve of the institutions, while it has always remained
the prevailing method in the day schools.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
A great extension is also found in the institutions
employing what is called the "combined
system," and in them more and more attention
is given to the teaching of speech.</p>

<p>The growth in the number of speech-taught
pupils may be indicated in the following table,
showing the number and percentage of those
taught speech in different years from 1884, the
year we first have record; of those taught wholly
or chiefly by the oral method since 1892; and also
of those taught wholly or chiefly by the auricular
method since 1893.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>It thus appears that in a little over a quarter
of a century the proportion of pupils in the
schools taught speech has nearly trebled; and that
in a score of years the proportion taught chiefly
or wholly by the oral method has more than
trebled. The proportion of the pupils taught
wholly or chiefly by the auricular method never
rises above two per cent.</p>

<p>It should be stated, however, that these figures
are not to be taken as meaning that all the pupils
thus enumerated have become proficient in the
employment of speech, or have become able to
speak clearly and intelligibly, and well enough
for general practical use. It would be nearest
the truth to say that they are "taught articulation,"
or that they are instructed by the use of
speech and speech-reading. Oftentimes the
greatest success lies in the preservation in fair
shape of the speech of those who have once had it.
The speech acquired by the deaf is of varying
degrees, as we have seen; but in some it may be
such as to be of distinct service, as well as the
lip-reading which may be said to go with it.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>


<h4>Present Methods of Instruction</h4>

<p>The methods of instruction at present employed
in American schools for the deaf are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
known as the manual, the manual alphabet, the
oral, the auricular and the combined. They are
thus described in the <i>Annals</i>:<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I. <span class="smcap">The Manual Method.</span>&mdash;Signs, the manual alphabet,
and writing are the chief means used in the
instruction of the pupils, and the principal objects
aimed at are mental development and facility in the
comprehension and use of written language. The degree
of relative importance given to these three means
varies in different schools; but it is a difference only in
degree, and the end aimed at is the same in all.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The Manual Alphabet Method.</span>&mdash;The manual
alphabet and writing are the chief means used in the
instruction of the pupils, and the principal objects
aimed at are mental development and facility in the
comprehension and use of written language. Speech and
speech-reading are taught to all of the pupils in the
school (the Western New York Institution) recorded as
following this method.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The Oral Method.</span>&mdash;Speech and speech-reading,
together with writing, are made the chief means
of instruction, and facility in speech and speech-reading,
as well as mental development and written language,
is aimed at. There is a difference in the different schools
in the extent to which the use of natural signs is allowed
in the early part of the course, and also in the
prominence given to writing as an auxiliary to speech
and speech-reading in the course of instruction; but
they are differences only in degree, and the end aimed
at is the same in all.</p>

<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The Auricular Method.</span>&mdash;The hearing of
semi-deaf pupils is utilized and developed to the greatest
possible extent, and with or without the aid of artificial
appliances, their education is carried on chiefly through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the use of speech and hearing, together with writing.
The aim of the method is to graduate its pupils as hard-of-hearing
speaking people, instead of deaf-mutes.</p>

<p>V. <span class="smcap">The Combined System.</span>&mdash;Speech and speech-reading
are regarded as very important, but mental development
and the acquisition of language are regarded
as still more important. It is believed that in many
cases mental development and the acquisition of language
can best be promoted by the Manual or Manual
Alphabet Method, and so far as circumstances permit,
such method is chosen for each pupil as seems best
adapted for his individual case. Speech and speech-reading
are taught where the measure of success seems
likely to justify the labor expended, and in most of the
schools some of the pupils are taught wholly or chiefly
by the Oral Method or the Auricular Method.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p></div>

<p>Of these methods the oral and the combined
are practically the only ones found. The auricular
is employed only in connection with certain
pupils in some of the schools; while the manual
method is found in but two schools, and the manual
alphabet in but one. In the institutions the
combined is by far the preponderating system,
being employed in all but fifteen of the sixty-five;
while the oral is employed in twelve. On
the other hand, the oral method is used in the day
schools almost altogether, there being but two
of the sixty-five schools employing the combined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
system. In the twenty-one denominational and
private schools the oral method predominates,
fifteen employing the oral or the oral and auricular,
and six the combined. In such schools, the
denominational more often employ the combined
method, while the strictly private are oral.</p>

<p>In respect to the number of pupils in the
schools using the two chief methods, we find that
83.7 per cent of those in institutions are in institutions
employing the combined system, and
13.9 per cent in oral institutions; that of those in
day schools 96.1 per cent are in oral schools, and
3.9 per cent in combined; and that of those in
denominational and private schools, 54.8 per cent
are in combined schools, and 45.2 per cent in oral.
Of all the pupils in the schools, 72.4 per cent are
in schools employing the combined system of instruction,
and 25.6 per cent in schools employing
the oral. The percentage taught by the manual
or manual alphabet method is 2.0. The percentage
given auricular instruction is 1.1.</p>


<h4>Courses of Study and Gradations of Pupils</h4>

<p>Schools for the deaf have courses of study corresponding
in general with those in regular
schools, although special emphasis and drill have
to be put upon language&mdash;something the congenitally
deaf child in particular finds exceedingly
difficult to use properly. Pupils capable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of taking the full course are carried through the
kindergarten, primary, intermediate, grammar
and high school grades; and on the completion
of the prescribed course may receive diplomas,
while in some cases a certificate may be granted
for a certain period of attendance. Not a large
proportion of the pupils, however, really graduate.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>In all the schools for the deaf in the United
States in the year 1912-1913 there were 14,474
pupils. Of these, 11,894, or 82.2 per cent, were
in institutions; 1,942, or 13.4 per cent, in day
schools; and 638, or 4.4 per cent, in denominational
and private schools.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> The instructors employed
in all the schools (not including teachers
of industries, but including superintendents or
principals) number 1,419, or one instructor for
every 9.5 pupils: in the institutions, 1,090, or one
to 10; in the day schools, 223, or one to 7.9; and
in the denominational and private, 92, or one to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
5.7.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> The total number of pupils who have received
instruction from the beginning is 72,453,
of whom 89.0 per cent have been in institutions,
7.7 per cent in day schools, and 3.3 per cent in
denominational and private schools.</p>

<p>The following table, based on the figures given
in the Report of the United States Commissioner
of Education will show the number of pupils in
the different grades and classes in the schools
for the year 1911-1912.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<h4>Industrial Training in the Schools</h4>

<p>The industrial training given in the American
schools for the deaf forms a very important feature
of the work&mdash;in many respects it may be
said to be the most important. In many of the
schools industrial instruction was recognized almost
from the very start, and in a number
it commenced practically with the beginning
of the work of education.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> It is now provided
in all the institutions, in nearly all the day schools,
and in over half of the denominational and private
schools. Many of the institutions have large,
well-equipped shop and trade departments, with
skilled and capable instructors. Nearly every
pupil at a suitable age is put at some industry,
and encouragement and special opportunity are
often given to those who show a particular bent
or aptitude. The value of this industrial preparation
of the schools in the after lives of the deaf
has already been referred to.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>The following table will show the number and
percentage of the pupils in the several kinds of
schools in industrial departments, according to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>

<p>In all the schools there are 403 industrial instructors,
373 being in institutions.<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>The industries taught in the schools, as given
in the <i>Annals</i>,<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Art, baking, barbering, basket-making, blacksmithing,
bookbinding, bookkeeping, bricklaying, broom-making,
building trades, cabinet-making, calcimining,
carpentry, chalk-engraving, cementing, chair-making,

coopery, dairying, domestic science, drawing, dress-making,
electricity, embroidery, engineering, fancy work,

Venetian iron-work, weaving, wood-carving, wood-engraving,
wood-turning, wood-working, working in
iron, and the use of tools.</p></div>

<p>The number and kinds of particular industries
taught in the different schools vary not a little.
In a few as many as a score are offered, while in
others only three or four are given. The average
seems to be about six or eight. The most usual
industries afforded are art, cabinet-making, carpentry,
cooking, domestic science, drawing, dress-making,
farming, gardening, laundering, painting,
printing, sewing, shoemaking, sign-painting,
tailoring, wood-working, and the use of tools.
The most common of all are carpentry, sewing,
printing, farming, shoemaking, and painting. In
most of the institutions papers are printed to afford
practical instruction in printing, as well as
to give local news of interest. These papers are
published weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. A number
of the schools, especially those in agricultural
states, also have small experimental farms in connection
with their industrial work, and dairy
farming and truck gardening are often given particular
attention.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_546_546" id="Footnote_546_546"></a><a href="#FNanchor_546_546"><span class="label">[546]</span></a> In America the one-hand alphabet is used practically altogether,
which is also the case with most of the countries of
Europe. In England the double-hand is employed mainly.
Finger-spelling, as well as sign-making, is very old with the
human race. The Egyptians, Greeks and Romans are said to
have made use of a system of finger notation. In the Middle
Ages monks in their enforced silence often resorted to a finger
alphabet. Dalgarno, one of the early English writers on the
deaf, had an alphabet in which the letters were represented
by parts of the hand. See J. C. Gordon, "Practical Hints to
Parents concerning the Preliminary Training of Young Deaf
Children", 1886, p. 34ff.; W. R. Cullingworth, "A Brief Review
of the Manual Alphabet for the Deaf", 1902.</p></div>

claimed that signs are free, and are as natural to the deaf as
spoken words to the hearing; that with certain of the deaf,
especially the congenitally deaf, they are all but indispensable;
that they cause mental stimulation as cannot otherwise
be done; that the acquisition of speech requires a great
amount of time, which is often needed for other things; that
the voices of many of the deaf are disagreeable and attract
notice; that communication readily and with pleasure among
the deaf by speech and speech-reading cannot be accomplished
to any wide extent; that only with the gifted few, and not
with the general body of the deaf, can such proficiency in the
use of speech and speech-reading be attained as to cause them
to be "restored to society", in that they can with ease and
with any considerable degree of satisfaction carry on intercourse
with the hearing; and that, finally, the great majority
of the deaf vigorously demand the retention of the sign language.</p></div>

method came into vogue in America, Gallaudet in his trip to
Europe having found the London and Edinburgh schools closed
to him, and having for this reason been compelled to turn to
France, where the sign method was in use.</p></div>

made their report, the American School at Hartford and the

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>COST TO THE STATE FOR EDUCATION</h3>


<h4>Value of the Property Used for the Education of
the Deaf</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> various provisions for the education
of the deaf have now been examined.
There is to be considered but one question
further. This is, what is the cost of it all? In
the present chapter we are to see if we may not
obtain some figures representing this cost to the
state. First we shall find what the plants, that
is, the grounds and buildings in actual use, are
worth in dollars and cents.</p>

<p>Taking the nearest available statistics, which
are those for the year 1912-1913, we have the
plants of the institutions valued at $16,856,338,<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
or, in round numbers, nearly seventeen million<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
dollars. In all the institutions there were in this
year 11,894 pupils, and we may thus calculate
that there is property worth $1,414 for each
pupil. We do not know the full value of the
property used in the day schools and the denominational
and private schools,<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> but this would no
doubt increase by some two million dollars the
value of the property employed in the instruction
of the deaf. Hence we have something like
nineteen million dollars as the amount invested in
plants for the education of the deaf in the United
States.</p>

<p>For new buildings, repairs, and general expenditures
for lasting improvements, so far as is
reported, there was expended on institutions
$848,068 for the year 1912-1913, which may represent
the yearly cost of the upkeep of the institutions.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
For the other schools we have few
figures, but they would add to this sum somewhat.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<h4>Cost of the Maintenance of the Schools</h4>

<p>For the maintenance of the institutions for the
year 1912-1913 there was expended $3,297,440.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
In forty-four, or about two-thirds, of the day
schools for the year 1911-1912 there was expended
$182,710, and on the basis of $120 as the
average cost of the pupils in them, we have $225,720
as the full cost of the support of the day
schools. For five of the private schools, the cost
per pupil was $225, and assuming that this will
hold for all, we have $133,550 as the full cost of
the support of such schools, a part of course
coming from tuition fees. Then our total expenditures
amount to $3,656,710,<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> or to over
three and a half million dollars, which represents
the annual cost of the education of the deaf in the
United States.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>


<h4>Form of Public Appropriations</h4>

<p>Save for certain endowment funds in a few institutions,<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>
and for limited donations in a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
number of schools, all the means for the support
of the schools for the deaf, other than the private
ones, come from the public treasury. In some of
the day schools there are municipal subventions;
in a few states the maintenance of certain pupils
is paid for by the counties from which they
come;<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> and in the case of the Columbia Institution
at Washington support is received from the
national government.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> With these exceptions,
the entire maintenance of the schools is undertaken
by the legislatures of the respective states.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p><p>Appropriations by the legislatures are usually
made in lump sums.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> In the case of the semi-public
institutions the allowances are upon a <i>per
capita</i> basis, being from $260 to $357, but more
often near $300. In a few of the state schools
appropriations are also based upon the number
of pupils, as in Alabama with $230 a year for
each pupil, in Kentucky with $150 a year, and in
Iowa with $35 a quarter, the last two states having
additional annual grants. In the states in
which pupils are sent to schools outside, a sum
of from $200 to $300 is allowed for each pupil
thus provided for. In a few cases funds are received
from a special tax assessment levied for
the benefit of the school, as in Colorado with a
one-fifth mill tax on the assessed property valuation
of the state,<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> and in North Dakota with six
per cent of one mill.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>
<h4>Cost to the State for Each Pupil</h4>

<p>The average cost for the support of the pupils
in the institutions for the year 1912-1913 was
$277.23.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> In few of the schools does the cost
go as low as $200, while in a number it is between
$300 and $400. The cost per pupil in the day
schools averages, where known, $120.60;<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> and in
the private schools, where known, $225.33.<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> For
pupils in the common schools of the country, the
average cost is $31.65.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> Thus it costs the state
eight times as much to educate its deaf children
in institutions as it does its hearing children in the
regular public schools, and four times as much to
educate them in day schools.</p>

<p>The education of the deaf, then, is not an inexpensive
undertaking on the part of the state.
Because of the special arrangements necessary
for its accomplishment, it comes high, compared
with the cost of education in general. But considered
merely as an investment, the outlay for
this instruction bears returns of a character surpassed
in few other fields of the state's endeavor.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_570_570" id="Footnote_570_570"></a><a href="#FNanchor_570_570"><span class="label">[570]</span></a> The figures in this chapter are for the most part from
<i>Annals</i> for January, 1914 (lix., pp. 26, 27), usually for the
latest fiscal year, these being supplemented in a few cases from
the Report of the United States Commissioner of Education for
1912 (ii., ch. xiii.). In the institutions where there are departments
both for the deaf and the blind, we have ascertained the
proportionate part for the deaf of the entire institution.
If no allowance is made for the blind in these, the worth of
all is $17,751,186, and the amount of property for each pupil
$1,492. For 1911-1912 the value of all was $16,454,798, or
according to the Report of the Commissioner of Education,
$16,387,726. In this Report the value of scientific apparatus,
furniture, etc., is stated to be $918,053.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_571_571" id="Footnote_571_571"></a><a href="#FNanchor_571_571"><span class="label">[571]</span></a> In most cases, as we have seen, the day schools are housed
in public school buildings, special establishments being provided
only in a few large cities. In the Report of the Commissioner
of Education, the property value of four day schools,
two being large ones, is put at $250,055, or $525 for each pupil;
and if this be accepted as a measure, the property value of all
the day schools is $1,019,550. The property value of seven
denominational and private schools is likewise given as $324,717,
or $1,358 for each pupil; and if this is taken as a measure,
the property value of all is $865,404.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_572_572" id="Footnote_572_572"></a><a href="#FNanchor_572_572"><span class="label">[572]</span></a> In 1910-1911 this was $503,323, and in 1911-1912, $772,245.
If allowance be made for the dual schools, it is about ten
per cent less. In the Report of the United States Commissioner
of Education it is placed at $568,136 for 1911-1912.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_573_573" id="Footnote_573_573"></a><a href="#FNanchor_573_573"><span class="label">[573]</span></a> With no allowance for the dual schools, this is $3,423,126.
In the Report of the Commissioner of Education it is $3,285,099,
for all but six institutions.</p></div>

this was estimated to be $3,200,000. Proceedings, p. 249.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_576_576" id="Footnote_576_576"></a><a href="#FNanchor_576_576"><span class="label">[576]</span></a> These endowment funds are found for the most part only
in certain of the semi-public institutions, and in a few state
schools which have received land from the federal government.
In the Report of the Commissioner of Education the
amount of productive funds in thirteen states for 1911-1912
is given as $3,372,565, as follows: Maine, $2,000; Massachusetts,
$193,674 (in 1910-1911, $369,723); Connecticut, $403,000;
New York, $1,002,633; Pennsylvania, $373,758; Maryland,
$4,500; District of Columbia, $11,000; Kentucky, $9,000;
North Dakota, $600,000; South Dakota, $400,000; Montana,
$160,000; Utah, $160,000; California, $53,000. Thus practically
two-fifths belongs in the states of Massachusetts, Connecticut,
New York and Pennsylvania, nearly one-third being in New
York alone; while a little under two-fifths belongs in North
Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Utah.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_577_577" id="Footnote_577_577"></a><a href="#FNanchor_577_577"><span class="label">[577]</span></a> This is especially true of New York, where the counties
pay the entire amount up to the age of twelve, and after
that the state.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_578_578" id="Footnote_578_578"></a><a href="#FNanchor_578_578"><span class="label">[578]</span></a> In this connection it may be noted that Congress has
been asked to grant $100,000 to "encourage the establishment
of homes in the states and territories for teaching articulate
speech and vocal language to deaf children before they are
of school age". Teachers are to be trained for this purpose,
and pupils are to enter at two years of age and remain till
the regular school age. See Report of Pennsylvania Home
for Training in Speech of Deaf Children, 1904, p. 5; Proceedings
of Conference of National Association for the Study
and Education of Exceptional Children, 1911, p. 64.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_579_579" id="Footnote_579_579"></a><a href="#FNanchor_579_579"><span class="label">[579]</span></a> Charges for clothing and transportation of indigent pupils
are as a usual thing paid for by the county, though this is
assumed by some states. Often a given sum, as thirty dollars,
is allowed for clothing, or the actual cost thereof is collected
from the county. This is done through the proper administrative
offices of the county, there being also some judicial
procedure, as where the county judge or similar official certifies
by proof. The school is then reimbursed for the expenditures
it may have made. Some such procedure is quite
general, especially in the South and West, though in a few
states, as Vermont and New Jersey, the town or township,
where this is the political division, plays a similar part.
In Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, Louisiana, California,
Nevada, and possibly other states, these charges are paid by
the state. In Maryland they may be paid by the county,
city or state.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_580_580" id="Footnote_580_580"></a><a href="#FNanchor_580_580"><span class="label">[580]</span></a> It happens sometimes that legislatures are inclined to
reduce the appropriations to as low a sum as possible, and
superintendents may receive commendation for efforts to cut
down expenditures. There is danger, however, that such a
policy may be carried to a point where efficiency is sacrificed to
seeming economy. On the question of cost, see Report of
Mississippi School, 1909, p. 11; Iowa Bulletin of State Institutions,

<h3>PUBLIC DONATIONS OF LAND TO SCHOOLS</h3>


<h4>Grants by the National Government</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">To</span> the schools in some of the states land has
been donated, either as an investment, the
proceeds of which should be used for their
benefit, or as sites for the erection of buildings.
This has been done by the national government,
by the states, by cities and by individuals and corporations.
The most important of such gifts have
been the grants of the public domain made by
Congress for the benefit of certain of the state institutions.
Shortly after the work of the education
of the deaf had commenced in the country, it
bestowed 23,000 acres upon the Hartford school
and a township of land upon the Kentucky.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>
After nearly three-quarters of a century it came
again materially to the aid of this education,
this time by directing that certain tracts of the
public lands located in states about to be admitted
to the Union should be set apart for the benefit
of the schools. Thus in the enabling act of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
1889<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> for the admission of the states of North
Dakota, South Dakota and Montana, land was
set aside for the benefit of the schools for the deaf
and the blind, which are mentioned by name. In
North Dakota and South Dakota the number of
acres allowed to each was 40,000, and in Montana
50,000.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Likewise when Wyoming was admitted
in 1890,<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> 30,000 acres were granted for an
institution for the deaf and the blind, though the
school has not yet been established. When Utah
was admitted in 1896,<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> 100,000 acres were
granted to the school for the deaf. On the admission
of Arizona and New Mexico in 1910,<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> like
amounts were respectively granted for institutions
for the deaf and the blind, 50,000 acres having
already been set aside in the latter while a
territory.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>
<h4>Grants by the States</h4>

<p>Grants by the states themselves for the schools
on a large scale have not been numerous. The
state of Texas has set apart large tracts of public
land for its institutions, the school for the deaf
coming in for 100,000 acres as its share. The
school in Michigan has received a number of sections
of the state salt spring lands, amounting to
16,000 acres.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>


<h4>Grants by Cities or Citizens</h4>

<p>Small tracts of land have been donated in some
cases by cities where the schools were to be established,
sometimes accompanied by a cash donation
as a further inducement for a particular
location. Similar gifts have been made by individuals
and corporations. These donations have
occurred in about half of the states, but they
have usually been small in size, most being of
five or ten acres.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

to the schools in California, District of Columbia, Illinois, New

schools. Larger tracts, of ten acres or more, have been given
in Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Michigan (state school and
Evangelical Lutheran Institute), Nebraska, Pennsylvania
(Western), South Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and
perhaps elsewhere. To the Kansas school 170 acres were
presented, to the Minnesota 65, to the Washington 100, to the
Oklahoma 60, to the school for the colored in Oklahoma 100,
and to the school for the deaf, together with that for the blind,
in Ohio 180. To the New York Institution for Improved Instruction
the city of New York granted the land for ninety-nine
years at an annual rental of one dollar.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>PRIVATE BENEFACTIONS TO SCHOOLS</h3>


<h4>Donations of Money to Schools</h4>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> our final chapter on the provision for the
schools for the deaf we are to consider how
far they have been assisted by private munificence.
We have already seen that certain of the
schools in the East&mdash;those we have called "semi-public
institutions"&mdash;were started by private
societies and were supported entirely by private
funds till the state came to their aid, though in
no instance was this dependence on private means
of long duration. We have also seen that in a
number of states private schools were first
started, in a brief time to be taken over by the
state, and thus received a modicum of private
aid. In addition, there have been from time to
time donations from private sources to one school
or another.</p>

<p>As to the entire amount of these private donations
to the schools, it is of course impossible to
say. The full receipts of the various schools cannot
be known, and our reckonings must necessarily
be incomplete.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> However, the data which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
we have are quite sufficient to enable us to discern
in what measure schools for the deaf have
been assisted by means other than public, and in
what proportion the distribution has taken place;
and our calculations, based on the best information
to be obtained, may not be altogether without
value.<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>We find, then, that to a considerable number
of the schools, apparently the majority, there
have been gifts large or small from private
sources. In most of these cases, however, the
gifts have been slight, and have almost always
come when the schools were being started, usually
ceasing soon after their establishment or their
taking over by the state. Nearly all the donations
of any importance have been to schools in
the East, the greater part also coming in their
early days and when still in private hands.</p>

<p>At present in the great number of the schools
such gifts are not bestowed. In perhaps a dozen
schools&mdash;practically all in the East&mdash;they are
still received in greater or lesser degree; and come
in three forms: 1. as membership fees in some
half dozen schools; 2. as certain annual donations,
varying in amount, in about the same number;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and 3. as an occasional legacy or similar gift
to some school or other.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>In respect to the funds already received, we
find that the great preponderance have fallen in
four states, namely, Connecticut, Massachusetts,
New York and Pennsylvania. In five others
there have been gifts of what may be called measurable
size: District of Columbia, California,
Colorado, Illinois, and Vermont. In the remaining
states private benefactions have been few:
where they have occurred they have been small
and infrequent.</p>

<p>In a score of schools or more there seem to have
been gifts of a few thousand dollars&mdash;hardly over
ten or fifteen thousand, and in most much less.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
In some sixteen, donations appear to have been
received of more appreciable size&mdash;twenty-five
thousand dollars and upwards. In about half of
these the gifts seem to have been from twenty-five
thousand to fifty thousand, in one or two
cases possibly more: the California, Colorado,
Columbia, New England (Massachusetts),
Sarah Fuller (Massachusetts), Pennsylvania
Home, and Austine (Vermont).<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> To six schools
donations seem to have reached a sum between
seventy-five or one hundred thousand dollars and
twice that amount. Four of these are in New
York: the New York Institution, the Institution
for Improved Instruction, St. Joseph's and Le
Couteulx St. Mary's; one in Pennsylvania, the
Western Pennsylvania; and one in Illinois, the
Ephpheta. In three schools the quarter million
mark has been passed: the American in Connecticut,
and the Clarke in Massachusetts, both
with receipts well beyond this figure; and the
Pennsylvania Institution, which has probably
been the largest recipient of all.</p>

<p>Total private gifts to schools for the deaf in
the United States would probably foot up to
little under two and a quarter million dollars, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
perhaps to two and a half millions, though these
figures cannot be fully substantiated.</p>


<h4>Gifts for Pupils in the Schools</h4>

<p>There have been gifts for the pupils in the
schools as well as for the schools themselves.
These have been of various kinds: clothing, books,
pictures, magazines, newspapers, Christmas presents,
prizes, etc., as well as money gifts in a few
cases. In many instances reduced transportation
has been allowed on railroads, and there have
been a number of benefactions of like character.
We have already referred to the funds left to
certain of the schools in trust for deaf-blind
pupils.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>


<h4>Present Tendencies of Private Benefactions</h4>

<p>Private benefaction, as we see, has not played
any great part in providing the means of education
for the deaf in the United States. In a few
schools private gifts have been of appreciable aid
in the work, but on the whole they have not been
of considerable moment, and in the great majority
of schools they have been practically
negligible. To judge from past experience, it
would not seem likely that in the future many
of the schools will to any great extent be beneficiaries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
from private means, or that they will
thus be enabled to extend their plants or to make
innovations as yet unattempted, though of course
such a thing is possible.</p>

<p>This condition, however, is not to be entirely
deplored. Many of the schools, it is true, could
receive large money benefactions to most desirable
ends, and in many cases the work of the
schools for the best results is hampered for lack
of sufficient funds. Yet the schools may feel that
they are in reality but agencies of the state in
carrying out one of its great functions, and as
such should have no need to call upon or depend
upon means other than the state's. Whether or
not in the course of time there may be an increased
incentive for private gifts, it would seem
that the schools should be entitled to look with
full confidence to the attention and care of the
state, since it is but contributing to the education
of its citizens.</p>

usually of $5,000. Some of the schools aided by fees are the
Pennsylvania Institution, Western Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania
Oral, New York Institution for Improved Instruction,

annual donations varying in amount are the New England

are affiliated to an extent with certain religious
bodies, receiving assistance from this source also. The smaller
denominational schools receive similar aid irregularly.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_598_598" id="Footnote_598_598"></a><a href="#FNanchor_598_598"><span class="label">[598]</span></a> Some of the schools that seem to have received gifts of
from five to fifteen thousand dollars, or thereabouts, are the
Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Central New York, Pennsylvania
Oral, Tennessee, and the day schools of Milwaukee. Some of
those that have received gifts somewhat smaller are the Alabama,
Illinois, Michigan, Mississippi, Horace Mann (Massachusetts),
Western New York, North Carolina, Virginia, and the
day schools of Chicago. More trivial or more uncertain amounts
have been received in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Maine, New
Mexico, Albany (New York), Oregon, South Dakota, Utah,
and the day schools of a few cities.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_599_599" id="Footnote_599_599"></a><a href="#FNanchor_599_599"><span class="label">[599]</span></a> Gifts to semi-public institutions as the Mystic, Connecticut,
and Boston, Massachusetts, have also probably been made,
though we do not know of what size; and also to some of
the denominational and private schools. The McCowen
Homes of Illinois have received some gifts, especially at their
beginning.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE WORK
FOR THE DEAF IN AMERICA</h3>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">We</span> have now examined the position of the
deaf in society in America and the
course and the extent of the treatment
accorded them. It only remains for us to inquire
if this treatment is well-considered, and how far
it is commensurate with the real, actual needs of
the deaf, and at the same time consonant with
the larger interests of society.</p>

<p>The question of paramount concern to society
is in respect to the possibilities of the prevention
of deafness. As yet it would seem that only a
minor degree of attention had been directed to
this consideration, though it is likely that in the
future much more serious study and thought will
be given to it. The problem is for the greater
part in the hands of medical science, and for much
of it we shall probably have to wait for solution
in the laboratory; while no small aid can be rendered
by general measures for the protection of
health. Already there can be little doubt that
there is less deafness from certain diseases than
in the past, though the statistics that we have on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the question are not as definite as could be wished.
The matter is really a part of the long battle
against disease, and as human skill takes one
position after another, it may be that many of
those diseases bringing deafness will be forced to
yield, and that such deafness will thus cease in
great part to be an affliction upon human flesh.</p>

<p>Eugenics also will be looked to for help, and it
may in time bring to light much that is now hidden
from our ken. As yet our knowledge of the
causes of deafness from birth is very imperfect.
A small part may be ascribed to consanguineous
marriages, and a larger part to the marriages of
those whose families are affected with deafness,
these perhaps not being wholly distinct, and together
comprising a little over half of congenital
deafness. Marriages of relatives, even though
not of frequent occurrence so far as deafness is
affected, have a relation to it which is not to be
ignored. Intermarriages of the deaf themselves
are not found for the most part to result in deaf
offspring; while the likelihood of such is not
always greater when both parents are deaf than
when one is deaf and the other hearing. The
one distinct fact of which we seem altogether
certain in this matter is that when there is in the
parent congenital deafness, or especially when
there are deaf relatives concerned, the chances are
vastly increased of deaf offspring. These are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
danger signals, and not to be passed without
heed. As to that form of deafness occurring
when consanguinity and antecedent deafness are
not involved, we are in greater ignorance. For
most of it, however, we may believe that there is
inherited some strain or influence predisposing to
deafness; and that in the discovery and application
of eugenic principles a greater or less portion
will be eliminated.</p>

<p>Though, so far as is discernible from the
immediate prospect, we cannot look to an early
disappearance of deafness from the race, there
are indications at present that deafness is tending
to become less. The probabilities are that the
future will be able to report advance, and so far
as the ultimate results are concerned, we have
no reason to be other than hopeful.</p>

<p>In respect to what has been accomplished for
the deaf since America has become concerned in
them, we have a record that may well be a distinct
cause of pride. The work for the deaf in
America is hardly a hundred years old. Yet in
that time there has transpired what, without
violence being done to language, can be called
a revolution. A century ago the deaf were practically
outside the pale of human thought and
activities. They were in a measure believed to
be without reason, and were little less than outcasts
in society. To-day they have become active<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
components of the state, possessed of education,
on a level with their fellow-men nearly everywhere
in the scale of human employment, capable
of all the responsibilities of life, and standing in
the full stature of citizenship.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first workers for the deaf had not
placed their faith too high after all, when they
declared that the deaf and dumb were to be restored
to the ranks of their species. Perhaps,
after all, the visions of these men have come true.
Perhaps this that we call education has had something
of the power they were trying to articulate.
For it has come about that a part of society
known as the deaf and dumb has been brought
to a place of honor and worth and usefulness in
the community in which they live.</p>

<p>However much of what was claimed has been
achieved, it is certain that a great part has been
realized. It has been by a slow, silent process,
keeping time with the years, but none the less
wonderful things have been wrought; and
through it all the advance of the deaf has been
constant and onward. It might be said with all
truth that this whole progress has been simply
the march of events. Education has ever been
the master passion of Americans, and in its wide
sweep the deaf too have been gathered in, and
have been borne to the place where all the state
had to offer as instruction was laid before them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
Yet it remains that by and through all this the
deaf have been the gainers as no other people in
the world have ever been, and their story is as
no other's in the rise of a section of mankind towards
the richness and fullness of living which
are the fruits of humanized society.</p>

<p>Great indeed can be the rejoicing of the deaf,
for they are those to whom the way has been hard
and long, but who have come from the darkness
into the light.</p>

<p>Yet the victory of the deaf is not complete.
They have not reached the full position among
men to which they are entitled. So long as people
look upon them as an unnatural portion of
the race, view them with suspicion or hold them
as of peculiar temperament and habits, or
otherwise consider them distinct from the rest
of their kind, and by voice or in their own consciousness
make use of terms or associations that
give fixedness to such a classification or differentiation:
just so long will the deaf be strangers
in the land in which they dwell; and just so far
will they be removed from the place in society
which should be theirs, and which is accorded to
all the rest of their fellow-men.</p>

<p>With regard to their economic position in the
world, the deaf have, on the whole, fared well.
Their own achievements have thrown out of court
the charge that they are a burden upon society.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
It has been proved by themselves that they are
not a dependent class, or a class that should exist
to any degree on the bounty of the state. They
are wage-earners to an extent that compares well
with the rest of the population, and, economically,
they form generally a self-sustaining part
of society. For a certain number who are aged
and infirm and are otherwise uncared for,
special homes are to be desired&mdash;and with such
the need is peculiarly strong. These, however,
do not comprise a large part of the deaf; and
with their exception there is practically no portion,
at least of those with an education, that demands
particular economic attention.</p>

<p>The community for the most part has been
quite ready and willing to recognize the status
of the deaf in this respect. Here the deaf are
accepted on equal terms with the people collectively,
and are in fact lost in the mass of the
world's workers.</p>

<p>The state has perhaps displayed more reluctance
to admit the deaf to the standing of its
other citizens, largely no doubt due to the fact
that in the sphere of law action is usually slow-moving,
and responds less readily to newly recognized
conditions. Though on the statute books
there are found few examples of legislation
directed to the deaf as if they were peculiarly in
need of the state's attention, and though such are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
hardly more than reminders of the past legal
attitude, they are mostly an anachronism to-day,
and should in great part be removed.</p>

<p>The courts have quite generally adopted the
true view in regard to the deaf, and hardly anywhere
now differentiate them. There is always
one particular kind of provision which may be
made for the deaf at law, and this is in the employment
of interpreters on proper occasion.
But even here the matter may be left to the ordinary
rules of the court, as well as to the good
sense and justice of the law-makers and the law-dispensers.</p>

<p>In most things, special attention of the law
in relation to the deaf is not often required, and
they should, in nearly all respects, be left in its
eyes exactly as the rest of their fellow-citizens.
When particular legislation is called for in
respect to them, it is needed rather to meet some
peculiar or unusual situation, which would probably
arise most frequently in connection with
some special abuse of the deaf, though such is
really seldom likely to occur. Provision for
young deaf children who are otherwise without
protection may well be included in "children's
codes," or in other statutes of similar kind. Useful
legislation is also feasible in connection with
departments for the deaf in state bureaus of
labor, the procedure possible being already indicated;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and it may be that a considerable field
will be revealed, not only in assisting the deaf in
securing employment but also in securing information
as to their condition. Opportunity is
open to the national government likewise in this
regard, and valuable statistics and other information
may be collected for the country generally.</p>

<p>In one further direction the law can be invoked
very materially in aid of the deaf, and just
where very little has been attempted. In every
state there should be enactments, backed up by
vigorous public opinion and the co-operation of
all citizens, providing severe punishment for
those who go about begging alms on the pretense
that they are deaf and dumb. For such creatures
the law should have no mercy. The deaf themselves
demand that such impostors be put out of
business, for a real and cruel injury is done to
them. They ask this as a great boon, but it
should be accorded them absolutely as a right.</p>

<p>The deaf do not want alms or pity. But in
unnumbered ways can they receive good at the
hands of their fellow-men. They need friends
as do all others, and power is never lost to the
right hand of fellowship. To be desired above
all else is the gaining of the right attitude on the
part of the community. As one great need, there
should be far more attention to the social and
spiritual concerns of the deaf, even though they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
are often found scattered and far apart. There
is much that can be done in many communities of
a social nature for the deaf, and in manifold forms
can life be made more abundant for them. Most
important of all, there should be no longer in
any place a neglect of the ministrations for the
cure of souls, and it should be seen that all of the
deaf are made to know the religion of the Man
of Galilee, with its untold blessings and consolations.</p>

<p>In our present review of the work for the deaf
in America, most of our attention has been directed
to the provisions for their education. It
may be said that to-day this work is as a rule of
a high order, and that in many respects, considering
the problems involved, it can compare well
with the work of education in general. There is
still more or less conflict as to methods, but this
does not seem vital to the success of the schools,
and their character has in general advanced.</p>

<p>In the beginning of instruction in some of the
states we read of the struggles of the early
schools, but eager hands came to push on the
new work. This work was taken up with an enthusiasm
and earnestness scarcely paralleled elsewhere
in the history of education, or in any other
of the great movements for the betterment of
human kind. Strong and brave souls manned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the new enterprise, and these early workers are
well worthy of honor at our hands.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, at the first, private societies came
forward as volunteers in the task of education,
but the states early recognized their duty, and
usually established schools as soon as they were
deemed practicable, either taking over the existing
private school or creating one of their own.
After a time, as another stage in their development,
the schools were made free by express provision,
or have become so to all practical purpose.
In time also all restrictions or limitations as to
the admission of pupils have been in general
swept away, and rules and regulations have come
more and more to conform with those in the regular
schools. Now education is offered to every
deaf child, and to the poor and destitute the state
provides all collateral necessaries as well, so that
instruction may be denied to none.</p>

<p>At present much the larger part of the deaf
are educated in institutions. But alongside this
plan there has grown, especially of late years, a
day school system with the pupils living in their
own homes, and the result is that in a number
of states such schools have now been established.
Their main field is recognized to be in large cities,
and it is here that they are able to be of the
greatest usefulness. It is still a mooted point,
however, how far they have passed the experimental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
stage, and it probably remains to be determined
to what extent they really offer advantages
to the deaf over the institutions. As a
part of this activity, and as an extension of the
general public facilities for education to the entire
community, we have also the question of
evening schools for adult deaf. There seems to
be a definite need for them in certain centers,
and it may well be hoped that much greater attention
will be given to the matter.</p>

<p>All the schools are really parts of the public
school system, with the exception of a comparatively
small number of private schools which have
been created in certain communities. In addition,
the work in America is characterized by a
national college, which represents the completing
mark in the system of their instruction. By
this the education of the deaf is made not only
to stand all along the way parallel with education
in general, but also to assume a place accorded
it in no other land.</p>

<p>In the schools one of the great features is the
industrial instruction, and this is rightly emphasized.
As much as the need of vocational
training is insisted upon on all sides to-day, with
the deaf it is essential to a greater degree
than it can be anywhere else. The pupils of the
schools who have had this industrial training as a
rule do well in the world, and in many cases put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
their training to most practical account. It could
be wished, however, that we had a careful and
detailed record, uniform over the country, of the
former pupils, which would be a test, demonstrative
as well as suggestive, of the efficiency of
the industrial training of the schools, and which
would be equally of value in other spheres of industrial
education.</p>

<p>Though in the work of the education of the deaf
in America, industrial instruction occupies a very
prominent part, yet in the schools there is an
abundance of "schooling" in the strictest sense.
The problems of the education of the deaf are
peculiar, and their instructors have to face
difficulties of a kind not found in any other
lines of education. Yet earnest thought and
study are being given to these problems, and
efforts made to solve them as far as it is possible.
In the conventions and conferences of instructors
notable work has been accomplished, and these
bodies are insistent upon progress and better
results.</p>

<p>For the greater efficiency and success of the
schools, the law as well as public sentiment can
be called in aid. Deaf children everywhere should
be prevailed upon or compelled to enter the
schools, and should be required to remain as long
as their best interests demand it. Education
should be a matter, forced if need be, for every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
deaf child, for terrible as ignorance always is,
in the deaf it is the most dreadful of all.</p>

<p>In America private assistance to schools for
the deaf has not been great, and very few schools
have been beneficiaries from resources other than
the state's. To-day, with the exception of a few
cases, aid from private means has ceased to be
expected, and calls for such bounty are now
seldom made.</p>

<p>At present nearly all the schools are public institutions,
and rely entirely upon the care of the
state. The state has in general recognized its
duty towards the education of the deaf, and has
engaged to provide for it. In half of the states
this responsibility is recognized, and provision
guaranteed in the organic law. In all the states
the legislatures have undertaken to see that means
of instruction are offered to all their deaf children,
and it is found that, all things considered,
the states have in general taken a keen interest
in their educational welfare. Few schools can
boast of overgenerous appropriations; many not
infrequently have failed to receive all that has
been asked for, and have thus often been prevented
from doing their best work. Yet it may
be said that if the legislatures have not always
responded with alacrity, or always bounteously,
or at all times with a full sense of their responsibility,
they have responded at least with cheerfulness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
and mindful of all the calls upon the state's
treasury, and often according to the best of their
light. It has been realized that the education of
the deaf is an expensive undertaking, far more so
than the education of ordinary children; but it is
none the less realized also that this education
pays&mdash;pays from every possible point of view.</p>

<p>That the school for the deaf is not given its full
educational recognition is a grievance in some
states, and this cannot be regarded otherwise
than unfortunate. In time, however, this will
most likely be changed, and the schools everywhere
will come into their proper standing, and
be considered only as the agencies of the state
for the education of its children.</p>

<p>The most deplorable thing in the treatment of
the schools by the state is that in some quarters
politics with its baneful influence has been allowed
to interfere. But as hideous and disgraceful
as is this action, we may now believe that in
most places its back has been broken, and that
hereafter men everywhere will think better of
themselves than to allow it in a single instance.</p>

<p>Finally, in respect to the work for the deaf in
America as a whole, it may be said that the state
makes but one form of provision in their behalf.
This is in allowing to all its deaf children a
means of education. Even this is hardly to be
called "provision for the deaf." It is rather the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
attention that is paid to a certain portion of the
population for its education. It is to be distinguished
from the provision for general education
only in that special means and methods are
necessary for its accomplishment.</p>

<p>This being done, the state may practically let
the deaf alone. No distinctive form of public
treatment is usually to be called for in respect to
them as a class. They demand little in the way of
special care or oversight, they are able as a rule
to look after themselves, asking few odds not
asked by other men, they have become citizens
without reservation or qualification, and economically
they form no distinct class, but are absorbed
into the industrial life of the state. They have
assumed the responsibilities of life in a highly
organized community, and in turn reap the
benefits that belong to all men in such an order.
But though this is true, their affliction bestowed
upon them by the partial hand of nature, is not
to be minimized, nor its effects lightened by any
human words. Their deafness rests indeed upon
them as a very material, tangible burden, so
sharp and pointed in its operations that they are
in great measure cut off socially from the rest of
their kind. Because of this their concern becomes
great in respect to the form of consideration from
the community about them, and their need turns
to one not so much of material character as of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
attention of the good neighbor. From their condition
all the more does it avail that no further
load should be placed upon them, and that their
prayer should be heard that they be treated fully
as men. For even with their ever missing sense,
the power of the deaf is only retarded, and not
seriously diminished, to derive from life much of
its richness and color and well-being.</p>
